# ANSWERS
# Comprehensive	Answers	and	Explanations

### Question # 1 - You	have	a	new	application	that	is	about	to	be	put	into	production	and used	by	customers.	Management	would	like	to	undertake	an	exhaustive test	of	the	system	by	assessing	the	known	controls	and	configurations	as well	as	reviewing	the	source	code	and	components.	Which	type	of	testing would	this	represent?    
A.	SAST  
B.	DAST  
C.	Pen  
D.	RASP  
Answer: A.	

Static	application	security	testing	**(SAST)**	assesses	both	the	source code	and	components	of	an	application.	It	is	done	as	a	**“white-box”** test,	as	those	performing	the	tests	have	full	access	to	the	actual	source code	and	configuration	documentation	of	the	application.	Tests	are done	against	an	offline	system.

B	is	incorrect	because	dynamic	application	security	testing	**(DAST)**	is run	as	a	**“black-box”	test**,	where	those	performing	the	test	have	no internal	or	particular	knowledge	of	a	system	and	must	discover everything	they	know	about	it	through	the	use	of	utilities.

C	is	incorrect	because	pen	testing	is	also	done	as	a	“black-box”	test, but	using	the	same	tools	and	methodologies	that	an	attacker	would	use in	order	to	evaluate	the	security	of	the	application.	Pen	testing	is designed	to	assess	vulnerabilities	in	various	types	of	real-world scenarios.

D	is	incorrect	because	runtime	application	self-protection	(RASP)	is used	to	test	against	systems	that	have	the	ability	to	detect	attacks	and threats,	and	then	to	automatically	adjust	their	security	settings	or	other configurations	to	compensate	for	and	mitigate	these	attacks	and threats.	RASP	is	designed	to	be	done	in	real	time	on	live	systems.

### [important] Question # 2 - An	employee	of	your	company	submitted	a	security	ticket	claiming	that	he was	able	to	access	areas	of	an	application	by	going	through	certain functions	that	he	should	not	be	able	to.	What	type	of	security	vulnerability does	this	best	illustrate?   
A.	Missing	function-level	access	control   
B.	Security	misconfiguration    
C.	Sensitive	data	exposure   
D.	Unvalidated	redirects	and	forwards    
Answer: A.	

Many	applications	will	do	authorization	checks	and	assign	access rights	when	a	user	first	accesses	the	application.	As	the	user	traverses the	application	and	accesses	different	functions,	if	the	application	does not	verify	authorization	for	each	function,	it	is	possible	for	the	user	to be	able	to	elevate	access,	either	intentionally	or	accidentally.	The application	should	verify	authorization	as	a	user	accesses	each	new function	or	piece	of	data.

B	is	incorrect	because	security	misconfiguration	refers	to	a	system where	baselines	were	not	correctly	applied,	unauthorized	changes were	made,	or	security	patches	and	updates	from	the	vendor	were	not applied.

C	is	incorrect	because	sensitive	data	exposure	occurs	when	protected data,	such	as	PII	or	credit	card	information,	is	not	properly	encrypted or	masked,	and	is	thus	susceptible	to	attackers.	This	exposure	refers	to specific	data	within	the	application	and	is	not	directly	related	to specific	functions	of	the	application.

D	is	incorrect	because	unvalidated	redirects	and	forwards	occur	when an	application	allows	external	links	or	redirects	but	does	not	properly validate	or	secure	them.	This	enables	an	attacker	to	potentially	redirect users	through	a	legitimate	and	secure	application	to	an	external	site	for phishing	attempts	or	other	malware	attacks.	This	site	will	appear	to	be safe	and	legitimate	to	the	users	because	it	originated	from	within	a trusted	application.

### Question # 3 - Where	would	be	the	most	appropriate	location	for	an	XML	firewall	within a	system	architecture?      
A.	Between	the	presentation	and	application	layers     
B.	Between	the	application	and	data	layers      
C.	Between	the	firewalls	and	application	servers     
D.	Before	the	firewalls      
Answer: C.

**An	XML	firewall	validates	XML	data	before	it	reaches	an application	server.**	
**The	appliance	can	perform	validation	as	well	as control	what	users	or	services	are	allowed	to	access	specific	XML functions	of	an	application.**	**Positioning	the	XML	firewall	between	the firewalls	and	applications	allows	for	initial	network	filtering	based	on origination	and	destination	of	packets	before	the	content	analysis	of the	appliance	is	performed	and	before	the	traffic	is	allowed	to	reach the	application	servers.**

A	is	incorrect	because	the	validation	and	scrutiny	of	XML	data	will need	to	be	done	before	the	request	reaches	the	application	from	the outside.	If	the	data	can	reach	even	the	presentation	layer,	then application	access	is	allowed,	which	could	let	in	malformed	or dangerous	data.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	data	would	have	already	reached	the application	servers	and	been	consumed	by	them	before	accessing	the data	layer,	which	would	allow	potentially	malformed	or	dangerous XML	data	into	the	application	and	through	processing	prior	to	being scrutinized.

D	is	incorrect	because	a	system	would	want	network	validation	done before	content	validation.	A	firewall	can	block	or	allow	specific	traffic from	legitimate	origins	as	a	first	line	of	defense	at	a	much	lower overhead	processing	cost	compared	to	the	content	analysis	required	by an	XML	firewall.

### Question # 4 - When	you	are	changing	to	a	different	data	center	for	a	disaster	recovery scenario,	which	of	the	following	could	pose	a	challenge	to	the authentication	systems	over	a	geographic	distance?    
A.	Regulations    
B.	Latency    
C.	Redundancy    
D.	Interoperability                   
Answer: B.	

**Authentication	systems,	as	a	security	check,	enforce	limited	time requirements	for	authentication	tokens	and	any	checks	to	be performed	and	validated.**	
If	it	takes	longer	than	the	allowed	time,	the request	will	be	**considered	stale	and	invalid**,	and	it	will	likely	loop back	to	try	the	process	again.	If	a	large	geographic	distance	exists	and network	latency	occurs,	it	is	possible	on	some	systems,	if	they	have
short	validity	periods,	for	authentications	to	fail	and	for	system	access to	be	denied.

A	is	incorrect	because	regulations	are	always	a	concern,	especially over	a	large	geographic	distance,	where	some	variations	are	almost guaranteed.	However,	this	is	not	the	best	answer	here	because	it	is	not specific	to	authentication	systems	and	their	operational	use.

C	is	incorrect	because	redundancy	is	not	something	that	will	be impacted	by	geographic	distance	between	data	centers.	Systems	can have	redundancy	implemented	in	a	variety	of	ways,	regardless	of where	they	are	actually	hosted	or	the	distance	between	them.

D	is	incorrect	because	interoperability	will	be	a	global	issue	across	the entire	enterprise,	not	one	specifically	impacting	authentication systems.	With	most	modern	authentication	systems,	interoperability	is also	not	a	primary	concern	because	these	systems	are	specifically designed	to	be	multiplatform	and	flexible.

### Question # 5 - Which	type	of	testing	involves	externally	attacking	the	security	of	asystem	but	without	actually	attempting	to	alter	systems	or	fully	execute malicious	actions?     
A.	DAST      
B.	SAST   
C.	Pen    
D.	RASP   
Answer: A.    	

**Dynamic	application	security	testing	(DAST)	is	run	as	a	“blackbox”	test	where	those	running	the	test	have	no	internal	or	particular knowledge	of	the	system	and	must	discover	everything	they	know about	it	through	the	use	of	utilities.	DAST	does	not	attempt	to	fully execute	malicious	actions	in	the	same	manner	as	pen	testing	does.**

B	is	incorrect	because	static	application	security	testing	(SAST) assesses	both	the	source	code	and	components	of	an	application.	It	is done	as	a	“white-box”	test,	as	those	performing	the	tests	have	full access	to	the	actual	source	code	and	configuration	documentation	of the	application.	Also,	tests	are	done	against	an	offline	system.

C	is	incorrect	because	pen	testing	is	also	done	as	a	“black-box”	test but	using	the	same	tools	and	methodologies	that	an	attacker	would	use in	order	to	evaluate	the	security	of	the	application.	It	is	designed	to test	vulnerabilities	in	**various	types	of	real-world	scenarios	and	to
actually	execute	exploits**.

D	is	incorrect	because	**runtime	application	self-protection	(RASP)** involves	testing	against	systems	that	have	the	ability	to	detect	attacks and	threats	as	well	as	to	automatically	adjust	their	security	settings	or other	configurations	to	compensate	for	and	mitigate	them.	RASP	is designed	to	be	done	in	real	time	on	live	systems.

### Question # 6 - A	common	strategy	to	mitigate	costs	when	using	a	cloud	solution	for disaster	recovery	is	to	leave	images	offline	at	the	DR	provider	and	only turn	them	on	when	needed.	Which	of	the	following	would	be	the	least significant	concern	with	this	approach?     
A.	Integrity     
B.	Patching    
C.	Confidentiality    
D.	Reversibility     
Answer: D.	

With	images	at	a	disaster	recovery	(DR)	site,	reversibility	is	still	a concern,	but	in	almost	all	cases	it	should	be	trivial	to	quickly	delete them	and	remove	them	from	the	system,	if	needed.	Although	still	a concern	in	any	cloud	deployment,	of	the	possible	choices,	reversibility would	be	the	least	concern	for	a	DR	focus.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	integrity	of	images	is	always	a	primary concern	within	a	cloud	environment.	Unlike	with	physical	servers, images	when	offline	can	still	be	accessed	via	a	compromised	system and	potentially	altered	or	compromised.

B	is	incorrect	because	patching	would	be	a	great	concern	when	images are	kept	offline.	The	patching	process	would	need	to	be	augmented	to guarantee	that	images	were	brought	online	and	patched	to	the	same level	as	current	production	systems	to	maintain	consistency.

C	is	incorrect	because	confidentiality	is	a	primary	concern	even	with images	that	are	offline.	In	an	offline	state,	the	images	still	reside	as files	within	the	storage	of	the	cloud	provider,	and	as	such,	a compromised	management	plane	or	hypervisor,	as	well	as	the	storage system	itself,	could	expose	those	files	to	access	and	copying.
  
### Question # 7 - Which	stage	of	the	BCDR	process	takes	into	account	the	RPO	and	RTO requirements	set	forth	by	management	and	stakeholders?    
A.	Gathering	requirements     
B.	Define	scope    
C.	Analyze    
D.	Implement   
Answer: A.	

When	you	are	gathering	initial	requirements	for	a	business continuity	and	disaster	recovery	(BCDR)	process,	the	recovery	point objective	(RPO)	and	recovery	time	objective	(RTO)	will	be	the	two primary	factors	that	drive	all	your	decisions	and	planning.	There	are many	ways	to	accomplish	continuity	and	disaster	recovery,	but	the requirements	for	the	point	and	time	are	the	ultimate	drivers	that determine	which	solutions	will	meet	management	objectives.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	scope-defining	stage	involves	taking	the requirements	and	determining	the	extent	of	the	project	or	application. By	this	point,	the	RPO	and	RTO	would	already	need	to	be	defined	and used	as	a	guide	to	establish	the	requirements	overall.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	analyze	stage	involves	taking	the	project requirements	and	translating	them	into	an	actionable	project	plan, complete	with	timelines	and	specific	ordering	and	objectives.	This would	occur	well	after	the	RPO	and	RTO	have	been	documented	and integrated.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	implementation	stage	involves	the	actual execution	of	the	project.	This	is	after	all	planning	has	been	completed and	documented.

### Question # 8 - Which	of	the	following	threats	from	the	OWASP	Top	Ten	is	the	most difficult	for	an	organization	to	protect	against?      
A.	Advanced	persistent	threats     
B.	Account	hijacking    
C.	Malicious	insiders     
D.	Denial	of	service    
Answer: C.	

Malicious	insiders	are	individuals	with	trusted	and	valid	access	to	a system	or	application	who	then	misuse	that	access	for	malicious	ends. This	can	include	stealing	data,	using	it	for	their	own	purposes,	selling it,	or	granting	others	unauthorized	access	to	it.

A	is	incorrect	because	advanced	persistent	threats	involve	users establishing	a	presence	within	an	application	or	system	and	then	using that	access	over	a	period	of	time	to	access	data	or	processes	to	steal information.	The	attacker	needs	to	first	establish	access	to	the	system, either	through	phishing	and	other	social	engineering	tactics	or	through traditional	system	compromises	and	vulnerabilities.	In	those	cases, security	personnel	and	administrators	can	utilize	countermeasures	to minimize	the	chances	of	compromise.

B	is	incorrect	because	account	hijacking	involves	either	a	shared account	being	abused	or	someone	gaining	access	to	another’s	account. Account	hijacking	can	be	minimized	by	policies	that	prevent	or	forbid account	sharing,	as	well	as	through	technological	measures	such	as requiring	multifactor	authentication.

D	is	incorrect	because	denial	of	service	(DoS)	does	not	actually involve	the	compromise	of	a	system	or	application,	but	is	rather focused	on	availability.	Many	different	approaches	are	available	for preventing	or	minimizing	the	impact	of	DoS	attacks	against	a	system.

### [tricky] Question # 9 - You	have	been	tasked	by	management	to	run	security	tests	against	an application	using	the	same	tool sets	and	methodologies	that	a	legitimate attacker	would	use,	including	actually	attempting	to	leverage	successful exploits.	Which	type	of	testing	would	this	entail?
A.	Dynamic	application	security	testing     
B.	Penetration	testing     
C.	Simulation	testing      
D.	Static	application	security	testing     
Answer: B.	

Penetration	(or	pen)	testing	is	done	as	a	“black-box”	test	but	using the	same	tools	and	methodologies	an	attacker	would	use	in	order	to evaluate	the	security	of	the	application.	It	is	designed	to	test vulnerabilities	with	various	types	of	real-world	scenarios	and	to actually	execute	exploits.

A	is	incorrect	because	dynamic	application	security	testing	(DAST)	is run	as	a	“black-box”	test	where	those	running	the	test	have	no	internal or	particular	knowledge	of	the	system	and	must	discover	everything they	know	about	it	through	the	use	of	utilities.	DAST	does	not	attempt to	fully	execute	malicious	actions	in	the	same	manner	as	pen	testing does.

C	is	incorrect	because	simulation	testing	is	not	a	type	of	security testing	that	is	a	part	of	the	CCSP	or	a	standard	type	in	general.	It	is simply	provided	as	an	erroneous	option.

D	is	incorrect	because	static	application	security	testing	(SAST) assesses	both	the	source	code	and	components	of	an	application.	It	is done	as	a	“white-box”	test,	and	those	running	the	tests	have	full	access to	the	actual	source	code	and	configuration	documentation	of	the application.	Also,	tests	are	done	against	an	offline	system.

### [important] Question # 10 - Which	of	the	following	types	of	threats	is	focused	on	compromising	the client	rather	than	the	server	or	application	itself?    
A.	Cross-site	scripting    
B.	Insecure	direct	object	references   
C.	Injection    
D.	Cross-site	request	forgery    
Answer: A.	

[important] **Cross-site	scripting	(XSS)	is	an	attack	where	a	malicious	actor	is able	to	send	untrusted	data	to	a	user’s	browser	without	it	going through	any	validation	or	sanitization	processes,	or	perhaps	the	code	is not	properly	escaped	from	processing	by	the	browser.	The	code	is	then executed	on	the	user’s	browser	with	their	own	access	and	permissions, thus	allowing	an	attacker	to	redirect	the	user’s	web	traffic,	steal	data from	their	session,	or	potentially	access	information	on	the	user’s	own computer	that	their	browser	has	the	ability	to	access**.

B	is	incorrect	because	insecure	direct	object	references	occur	when	a developer	has	in	their	code	a	reference	to	something	on	the	application side,	such	as	a	database	key,	the	directory	structure	of	the	application, configuration	information	about	the	hosting	system,	or	any	other information	that	pertains	to	the	workings	of	the	application	that	should not	be	exposed	to	users	or	the	network.

C	is	incorrect	because	an	injection	attack	is	where	a	malicious	actor sends	commands	or	other	arbitrary	data	through	input	and	data	fields with	the	intent	of	having	the	application	or	system	execute	the	code	as part	of	its	normal	processing	and	queries.	This	can	trick	an	application into	exposing	data	that	is	not	intended	or	authorized	to	be	exposed,	or it	could	potentially	allow	an	attacker	to	gain	insight	into configurations	or	security	controls.

D	is	incorrect	because	a	cross-site	request	forgery	attack	forces	an authenticated	client	that	a	user	has	open	to	send	forged	requests	under the	user’s	own	credentials	to	execute	commands	and	requests	that	the application	thinks	are	coming	from	a	trusted	client	and	user.

### [important] Question # 11 - Which	concept	refers	to	the	ability	to	validate	and	prove	that	a	specific entity	did	not	perform	operations	on	a	system?     
A.	Repudiation     
B.	Validation     
C.	Integrity     
D.	Authentication    
Answer: A.	

Repudiation	relates	to	the	ability	to	prove	that	a	specific	user	or entity	did	not	perform	specific	functions	or	access	specific	data	within a	system	or	application.	With	comprehensive	logging,	any	transaction on	a	system	is	open	to	dispute	or	challenge	by	a	user,	who	can	claim they	never	performed	the	type	of	transaction	the	system	says	they	did or	challenge	the	data	contained	on	the	system.

B	is	incorrect	because	validation	often	refers	to	ensuring	that	data inputs	are	in	the	correct	format	and	within	acceptable	parameters.	It does	not	pertain	to	verifying	the	specific	source	or	maintaining documentation	that	can	later	be	used	to	prove	it.

C	is	incorrect	because	integrity	relates	to	the	assurance	that	data	has not	been	altered,	created,	or	deleted	by	unauthorized	parties	or processes.	It	is	not	related	to	proving	that	a	specific	entity	performed an	operation.

D	is	incorrect	because	authentication	involves	the	ability	to	prove	an identity	to	a	system	or	service	to	satisfy	the	particular	requirements	to meet	that	burden	of	proof.	It	is	not	related	to	proving	that	a	specific entity	conducted	an	operation	on	a	service.

### Question # 12 - Which	of	the	following	software	applications	is	not	a	utility	for	managing code	or	system	configurations?    
A.	Puppet    
B.	Chef   
C.	Shibboleth   
D.	GitHub   
Answer: C.	

Shibboleth	is	an	open	source,	federated	identity	system	that	is widely	used	by	universities,	nonprofits,	government	agencies,	and other	resource-	or	technology-related	organizations.

A	is	incorrect	because	puppet	is	an	open	source	software	package	that is	used	to	maintain	configurations	on	different	types	of	systems	and operates	via	an	agent	installed	on	each	system.

B	is	incorrect	because	Chef	is	a	software	package	for	deploying	and configuring	servers	in	a	manner	where	configuration	is	treated	like code	and	deployed	to	servers	for	execution.

D	is	incorrect	because	GitHub	is	a	very	widely	used	software	platform that	provides	a	code	repository	for	collaborative	development, including	branching	and	versioning	capabilities.

### [important] Question # 13 - During	an	incident	investigation	from	a	suspected	breach,	it	was discovered	that	some	application	code	contained	the	names	of	underlying databases	and	systems	that	were	able	to	be	read	by	the	attacker.	What	type of	vulnerability	does	this	best	represent?     
A.	Injection    
B.	Sensitive	data	exposure    
C.	Security	misconfigurations     
D.	Insecure	direct	object	references    
Answer: D.	

Insecure	direct	object	references	occur	when	a	developer	has	in their	code	a	reference	to	something	on	the	application	side	such	as	a database	key,	the	directory	structure	of	the	application,	configuration information	about	the	hosting	system,	or	any	other	information	that pertains	to	the	workings	of	the	application	that	should	not	be	exposed to	users	or	the	network.

A	is	incorrect	because	an	injection	attack	is	where	a	malicious	actor sends	commands	or	other	arbitrary	data	through	input	and	data	fields with	the	intent	of	having	the	application	or	system	execute	the	code	as part	of	its	normal	processing	and	queries.	This	can	trick	an	application into	exposing	data	that	is	not	intended	or	authorized	to	be	exposed,	or potentially	allow	an	attacker	to	gain	insight	into	configurations	or security	controls.

B	is	incorrect	because	sensitive	data	exposure	relates	to	web applications	regularly	utilizing	sensitive	user	data,	such	as	credit cards,	authentication	credentials,	personally	identifiable	information (PII),	and	financial	information.	If	this	information	is	not	properly protected	through	encryption	and	secure	transport	mechanisms,	it	can quickly	become	an	easy	target	for	attackers.	Web	applications	must enforce	strong	encryption	and	security	controls	on	the	application side,	but	also	require	secure	methods	of	communication	with	browsers
and	other	clients	that	are	used	for	accessing	the	information.

C	is	incorrect	because	security	misconfigurations	occur	when applications	and	systems	are	not	properly	configured	or	maintained	in a	secure	manner.	This	can	be	due	to	a	shortcoming	in	security baselines	or	configurations,	unauthorized	changes	to	system configurations,	or	a	failure	to	patch	and	upgrade	systems	as	security patches	are	released	by	the	vendor.	Security	misconfigurations	also include	not	changing	the	default	configurations	or	credentials	that come	with	an	application	prior	to	its	use	and	deployment.

### Question # 14 - What	standard	is	used	between	different	entities	within	a	federated	system to	exchange	information	about	authentication	and	user	attributes?  
A.	SAML   
B.	XML   
C.	HTML   
D.	TLS   
Answer: A.	

[important] The	Security	Assertion	Markup	Language	(SAML)	is	**an	open standard**	for	**exchanging	information	for	authentication	and authorization	between	an	identity	provider	and	a	relying	party**.	
**SAML provides	information	to	ensure	that	authentication	has	been	completed successfully**.	
It	also	provides	the	identification	for	the	identity provider	and	organization	as	well	as	a	set	of	attributes	about	the	user to	be	given	to	the	relying	party.

B	is	incorrect	because	XML	is	similar	to	SAML	in	structure	and format,	but	is	not	used	for	exchanging	information	with	a	federated system.	XML	is	a	standard	format	for	encoding	and	exchanging information,	but	it	is	not	used	specifically	for	authentication	and authorization.

C	is	incorrect	because	HTML	is	used	for	encoding	web	pages	to	be consumed	by	clients	such	as	web	browsers.	It	is	not	a	protocol	or specification	for	exchanging	information	in	the	same	manner	as	XML or	SAML.

D	is	incorrect	because	TLS	is	specifically	for	facilitating	secure communication	between	two	parties,	including	negotiating	the connection	and	then	actually	encrypting	and	protecting	packets	as	they are	transmitted	between	the	two	parties.	It	is	heavily	used	within federated	systems,	but	is	not	the	protocol	used	for	actually	passing information	between	the	two	parties.	It	just	secures	the	information.

### Question # 15 - Which	concept	is	often	used	to	isolate	and	separate	information	or processes	within	an	environment	for	either	security	concerns	or	regulatory requirements?     
A.	Virtualization    
B.	Segregation     
C.	Sandboxing     
D.	Honeypots     
Answer: C.	

Sandboxing	involves	the	segregation	and	isolation	of	information	or processes	from	others	within	the	same	system	or	application,	typically for	security	concerns.	Sandboxing	typically	is	used	for	data	isolation, such	as	keeping	different	communities	and	populations	of	users	with similar	data	isolated	from	each	other.	The	need	for	sandboxing	can	be due	to	internal	reasons,	such	as	policies,	or	it	can	come	from	external sources,	such	as	regulatory	or	legal	requirements.

A	is	incorrect	because	virtualization	involves	hosting	multiple different	systems	under	the	same	physical	hardware.	The	hosts	are	run under	the	supervision	and	control	of	a	hypervisor	instead	of	given direct	access	to	the	underlying	hardware.	Virtualization	is	not specifically	used	for	separation	of	systems	or	information	for	security or	regulatory	requirements.

B	is	incorrect	because	segregation	is	a	general	concept	that	relates	to the	topic	of	the	question	but	is	not	an	official	term	or	concept	used within	computing.	It	is	provided	as	an	erroneous	answer.

D	is	incorrect	because	honeypots	are	special	systems	designed	to appear	in	configuration	and	data	as	production	systems,	but	they	are kept	isolated	and	use	fake	data	for	the	purposes	of	enticing	attackers to	them.	This	allows	an	organization	to	learn	about	the	types	of	attacks being	employed	against	their	systems	and	to	determine	additional	or different	security	approaches	for	their	actual	systems.

### [important] Question # 16 - Which	type	of	threat	is	often	used	in	conjunction	with	phishing	attempts and	is	often	viewed	as	greatly	increasing	the	likeliness	of	success?  
A.	Unvalidated	redirects	and	forwards    
B.	Cross-site	request	forgery    
C.	Cross-site	scripting    
D.	Insecure	direct	object	references    
Answer: A.	

[important] **Unvalidated	redirects	and	forwards	occur	when	an	application allows	external	links	or	redirects	but	does	not	properly	validate	or secure	them.	
This	allows	an	attacker	to	potentially	redirect	users through	a	legitimate	and	secure	application	to	an	external	site	for phishing	attempts	or	other	malware	attacks.	
The	site	will	appear	to	be safe	and	legitimate	to	the	user	because	it	originated	from	within	a trusted	application**.

B	is	incorrect	because	a	cross-site	request	forgery	attack	forces	an authenticated	client	that	a	user	has	open	to	send	forged	requests	under the	user’s	own	credentials	to	execute	commands	and	requests	that	the application	thinks	are	coming	from	a	trusted	client	and	user.

C	is	incorrect	because	cross-site	scripting	is	an	attack	where	a malicious	actor	is	able	to	send	untrusted	data	to	a	user’s	browser without	going	through	any	validation	or	sanitization	processes,	or perhaps	the	code	is	not	properly	escaped	from	processing	by	the browser.	The	code	is	then	executed	on	the	user’s	browser	with	their own	access	and	permissions,	thus	allowing	an	attacker	to	redirect	their web	traffic,	steal	data	from	their	session,	or	potentially	access information	on	the	user’s	own	computer	that	their	browser	has	the ability	to	access.

D	is	incorrect	because	insecure	direct	object	references	occur	when	a developer	has	in	their	code	a	reference	to	something	on	the	application side,	such	as	a	database	key,	the	directory	structure	of	the	application, configuration	information	about	the	hosting	system,	or	any	other information	that	pertains	to	the	workings	of	the	application	that	should not	be	exposed	to	users	or	the	network.

### [important] Question # 17 - What	is	the	primary	security	mechanism	used	to	protect	SOAP	and	REST APIs?    
A.	Firewalls    
B.	XML	firewalls    
C.	Encryption    
D.	WAFs    
Answer: C.	

**The	SOAP	and	REST	APIs	do	not	have	built-in	security mechanisms**	and	must	rely	on	external	mechanisms.	
**The	primary means	to	protect	both	APIs	is	through	the	use	of	encryption**,	
**typically through	the	use	of	TLS	to	secure	the	transmission**	of	data	across	the networks	between	the	clients	and	services.

A	is	incorrect	because	although	firewalls	may	be	used	with	some	APIs to	limit	and	control	access	to	them,	it	does	not	provide	as	thorough security	as	encryption,	nor	does	it	secure	the	data	transmissions	from the	APIs	at	all.

B	is	incorrect	because	XML	firewalls	are	used	to	validate	and	control XML	flowing	into	a	system.	They	may	be	used	with	APIs	for additional	security	and	XML	validation	offloading,	but	they	will	not secure	the	data	transmissions	across	the	network	from	the	APIs.

D	is	incorrect	because	a	web	application	firewall	(WAF)	will	enable extensive	filtering	and	security	checks	on	the	content	of	data	packets flowing	between	API	services,	but	they	will	not	secure	the	actual	data transmissions	in	any	way.

### [tricky] Question # 18 - Which	type	of	testing	tends	to	produce	the	best	and	most	comprehensive results	for	discovering	system	vulnerabilities?    
A.	Static   
B.	Dynamic   
C.	Pen   
D.	Vulnerability    
Answer: A.	

Static	application	security	testing	(SAST)	tests	both	the	source	code and	components	of	an	application.	It	is	done	as	a	“white-box”	test,	as those	running	the	tests	have	full	access	to	the	actual	source	code	and configuration	documentation	of	the	application.	Also,	tests	are	done against	an	offline	system.	SAST	is	considered	the	most comprehensive	type	of	testing	due	to	the	knowledge	of	the	systems and	access	to	source	code	by	the	testers.

B	is	incorrect	because	dynamic	application	security	testing	(DAST)	is run	as	a	“black-box”	test	where	those	running	the	test	have	no	internal or	particular	knowledge	of	the	system	and	must	discover	everything they	know	about	it	through	the	use	of	utilities.	DAST	does	not	attempt to	fully	execute	malicious	actions	in	the	same	manner	as	pen	testing.

C	is	incorrect	because	pen	testing	is	done	as	a	“black-box”	test,	but using	the	same	tools	and	methodologies	that	an	attacker	would	use	in order	to	evaluate	the	security	of	the	application.	Pen	testing	is designed	to	assess	vulnerabilities	with	various	types	of	real-world scenarios	and	to	actually	execute	exploits.

D	is	incorrect	because	vulnerability	scanning	is	done	using	a predefined	set	of	signatures	and	parameters	to	evaluate	a	system	and give	a	risk	rating	based	on	the	findings.	Vulnerability	scanning	does not	involve	extensive	knowledge	of	a	system	or	go	beyond	the preconfigured	tests	that	are	run	for	compliance.

### [very important] Question # 19 - Which	of	the	following	represents	the	R	component	of	the	DREAD	threat risk	modeling	system?    
A.	Reproducibility    
B.	Repudiation    
C.	Redundancy    
D.	Reversibility    
Answer: A.	

[important] **Reproducibility	is	the	measure	of	how	easy	it	is	to	reproduce	an exploit**.	
On	the	low	end,	a	value	of	0	signifies	a	near	impossibility	of exploit,	even	with	administrative	access.	
This	would	likely	occur where	other	defensive	measures	prevent	access	or	exploit.	
On	the	high end,	a	value	of	10	signifies	an	easy	exploit,	such	as	simply	accessing the	application	with	a	client,	without	needing	authentication	or	other methods.	
Any	value	in	the	middle	will	be	subjective	and	determined based	on	the	particulars	of	the	application,	as	well	as	any	other mitigating	factors	from	other	defensive	mechanisms.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	R	component	of	the	DREAD	threat	risk model	is	reproducibility,	not	repudiation.
C	is	incorrect	because	the	R	component	of	the	DREAD	threat	risk model	is	reproducibility,	not	redundancy.
D	is	incorrect	because	the	R	component	of	the	DREAD	threat	risk model	is	reproducibility,	not	reversibility.

### Question # 20 - During	a	periodic	or	specific	testing	of	a	BCDR	plan,	which	of	the following	pairs	of	objectives	is	the	main	metric	used	for	the	overall evaluation	of	the	plan?    
A.	RPO	and	SRE   
B.	RSL	and	RTO   
C.	RTO	and	RPO   
D.	ARO	and	RSL   
Answer: C.	

During	a	BCDR	test,	the	recovery	time	objective	(RTO)	and	the recovery	point	objective	(RPO)	are	the	two	main	objectives	that	are tested	and	evaluated.	The	RPO	is	defined	by	management	as	the	point where	a	successful	restore	of	an	environment	will	have	occurred,	and the	RTO	represents	the	acceptable	amount	of	time	required	to	do	so.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	RPO	and	RTO	are	the	key	metrics	and considerations	of	a	BCDR	test.
B	is	incorrect	because	the	RPO	and	RTO	are	the	key	metrics	and considerations	of	a	BCDR	test.
D	is	incorrect	because	the	RPO	and	RTO	are	the	key	metrics	and considerations	of	a	BCDR	test.

### [important] Question # 21 - Which	of	the	following	options	would	be	possible,	in	conjunction	with	a USB	drive,	to	fulfill	an	application’s	multifactor	authentication requirements?     
A.		RFID	chip	card   
B.	Password    
C.	RSA	token    
D.	Access	card   
Answer: B.	

A	USB	thumb	drive	represents	something	that	a	user	possesses. Because	a	password	is	something	that	a	user	knows,	it	would	be	an appropriate	factor	to	use	with	a	USB	drive	for	multifactor authentication.

A	is	incorrect	because	a	USB	thumb	drive	represents	something	that	a user	has	or	possesses,	which	is	also	the	same	category	as	an	RFID chip	card.	As	such,	an	RFID	chip	card	would	not	be	appropriate	to	use to	fulfill	multifactor	authentication	requirements	because	it	comes from	the	same	class	of	credentials.

C	is	incorrect	because	a	USB	thumb	drive	represents	something	that	a user	has	or	possesses,	which	is	also	the	same	category	as	an	RSA token.	As	such,	an	RSA	token	would	not	be	appropriate	to	use	to fulfill	multifactor	authentication	requirements	because	it	comes	from the	same	class	of	credentials.

D	is	incorrect	because	a	USB	thumb	drive	represents	something	that	a user	has	or	possesses,	which	is	also	the	same	category	as	an	access card.	As	such,	an	access	card	would	not	be	appropriate	to	use	to	fulfill multifactor	authentication	requirements	because	it	comes	from	the
same	class	of	credentials.

### Question # 22 - Which	of	the	following	types	of	organizations	is	most	likely	to	make	use of	open	source	software	technologies?   
A.	Government	agencies   
B.	Corporations    
C.	Universities   
D.	Military   
Answer: C.	

Universities	make	extensive	use	of	open	source	technologies, especially	compared	to	other	types	of	organizations.	There	are multiple	reasons	why	this	is	the	case.	One	reason	is	that	the	open	and research-oriented	nature	of	universities	makes	them	more	accepting	of open	source	technologies.	Another	reason	is	the	more	stringent budgetary	realities	that	many	universities	face.

A	is	incorrect	because	government	agencies	for	the	most	part	do	not make	extensive	use	of	open	source	technologies,	in	many	instances due	to	audit	and	support	requirements	by	law	or	regulation.

B	is	incorrect	because	corporations	do	not	typically	make	extensive use	of	open	source	technologies	and	tend	to	defer	to	proprietary software	that	comes	with	support.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	military	tends	to	use	proprietary	software that	comes	with	support—especially	software	that	is	written specifically	for	its	unique	needs	and	requirements.

### [important] Question # 23 - Which	component	consumes	assertions	from	identity	providers	and	makesa	determination	as	to	whether	to	grant	access,	and	at	what	level,	if applicable	to	a	user?     
A.		Service	party    
B.	Application	provider   
C.	Service	broker    
D.	Relying	party    
Answer: D.	

[important] **A	relying	party	consumes	security	assertions	from	identity providers	and	then	makes	decisions	as	to	whether	to	grant	access	and at	what	level**.	The	decisions	can	be	based	on	anything	about	the	user that	is	presented	in	the	attributes	from	the	identity	provider,	such	as status,	organization,	and	location.

A	is	incorrect	because	service	party	is	a	similar	sounding	term	to relying	party,	but	it	is	not	the	correct	term.

B	is	incorrect	because	application	provider	is	not	a	term	associated with	a	federated	identity	system.

C	is	incorrect	because	a	service	broker	is	a	different	concept	that	is	not related	to	the	components	of	a	federated	identity	system.

### [very important] Question # 24 - Which	of	the	following	choices	represents	the	D	component	of	the STRIDE	threat	model	from	OWASP?    
A.	Data	loss   
B.	Data	breach   
C.	Denial	of	service    
D.	Disclosure    
Answer: C.	

The	D	component	of	the	STRIDE	threat	model	refers	to	denial	of service.	Any	application	is	a	possible	target	of	a	denial	of	service attack.	From	the	application	side,	the	developers	should	minimize	how many	operations	are	performed	for	unauthenticated	users.	This	will keep	the	application	running	as	quickly	as	possible	and	using	the	least amount	of	system	resources	to	help	minimize	the	impact	of	any	such attacks.	The	use	of	front-end	caching	technologies	can	also	minimize the	impact	of	attacks	because	they	will	remove	many	queries	from	the actual	application	servers.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	D	component	of	the	STRIDE	threat	model refers	to	denial	of	service,	not	data	loss.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	D	component	of	the	STRIDE	threat	model refers	to	denial	of	service,	not	data	breach.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	D	component	of	the	STRIDE	threat	model refers	to	denial	of	service,	not	disclosure.

### [tricky important] Question # 25 - Many	organizations	will	have	different	environments	for	developmentversus	production,	even	using	different	cloud	providers	or	different systems	between	the	two.	Which	of	the	following	would	be	the	BEST reason	to	have	both	production	systems	and	development	systems	hosted within	the	same	cloud	environment?    
A.	Operating	systems    
B.	VPN	access    
C.	Storage	systems   
D.	APIs    
Answer: D.	

Cloud	providers	have	their	own	suite	of	APIs	that	are	offered	and maintained	within	their	environments	and	are	available	to	customers. Having	both	production	and	development	systems	hosted	within	the same	cloud	provider	will	ensure	that	the	same	APIs	are	available	and used	throughout	the	system,	thus	lessening	the	possibility	of	problems originating	when	code	is	moved	into	a	new	environment	for production	release.

A	is	incorrect	because	operating	systems	will	typically	be	widely available	across	cloud	environments	and	not	specifically	dependent	on the	environment.

B	is	incorrect	because	VPNs	are	widely	used	through	cloud environments,	and	the	same	capabilities	should	be	available	regardless of	environment.	Also,	a	VPN	will	generally	not	have	a	direct	impact on	the	availability	or	functioning	of	an	application.

C	is	incorrect	because	storage	systems	among	the	various	cloud providers	could	have	differences,	but	overall	they	should	operate	and appear	consistent	to	the	applications	and	systems	hosted	within	them. They	should	not	pose	a	significant	burden	due	to	a	move	between providers	unless	a	specific	proprietary	storage	system	that	is	unique	to a	cloud	provider	is	used.

### Question # 26 - It	was	discovered	that	an	attacker	was	able	to	send	properly	formatted SQL	code	through	your	web	application	in	order	to	obtain	the	entire schema	of	the	underlying	database.	What	type	of	attack	does	this	best represent?     
A.		Injection    
B.	Sensitive	data	exposure    
C.	Security	misconfiguration    
D.	Insecure	direct	object	references   
Answer: A.	

An	injection	attack	is	where	a	malicious	actor	sends	commands	or other	arbitrary	data	through	input	and	data	fields	with	the	intent	of having	the	application	or	system	execute	the	code	as	part	of	its	normal processing	and	queries.	This	can	trick	an	application	into	exposing data	that	is	not	intended	or	authorized,	or	it	can	potentially	allow	an attacker	to	gain	insight	into	configurations	or	security	controls.

B	is	incorrect	because	sensitive	data	exposure	refers	to	how	many	web applications	regularly	utilize	sensitive	user	data,	such	as	credit	cards, authentication	credentials,	personally	identifiable	information	(PII), and	financial	information.	If	this	information	is	not	properly	protected through	encryption	and	secure	transport	mechanisms,	it	can	quickly become	an	easy	target	for	attackers.	Web	applications	must	enforce strong	encryption	and	security	controls	on	the	application	side,	but also	secure	methods	of	communication	are	also	required	with browsers	and	other	clients	that	are	used	to	access	the	information. With	sensitive	information,	applications	should	ideally	perform checks	against	browsers	to	ensure	they	meet	security	standards	based on	the	versions	and	protocols	supported.

C	is	incorrect	because	security	misconfiguration	occurs	when applications	and	systems	are	not	properly	configured	or	maintained	in a	secure	manner.	This	can	be	due	to	a	shortcoming	in	security baselines	or	configurations,	unauthorized	changes	to	system configurations,	or	a	failure	to	patch	and	upgrade	systems	as	security patches	are	released	by	the	vendor.	Security	misconfiguration	also includes	not	changing	the	default	configurations	or	credentials	that come	with	an	application	prior	to	its	use	and	deployment.

D	is	incorrect	because	insecure	direct	object	references	occur	when	a developer	has	in	their	code	a	reference	to	something	on	the	application side	such	as	a	database	key,	the	directory	structure	of	the	application, configuration	information	about	the	hosting	system,	or	any	other information	that	pertains	to	the	workings	of	the	application	that	should not	be	exposed	to	users	or	the	network.

### Question # 27 - Your	application	has	been	a	continued	target	for	SQL	injection	attempts.Which	of	the	following	technologies	would	be	best	used	to	combat	the likeliness	of	a	successful	SQL	injection	exploit	from	occurring?     
A.	XML	accelerator  
B.	WAF    
C.	Sandbox    
D.	Firewall    
Answer: B.	

A	web	application	firewall	(WAF)	is	an	appliance	or	plug-in	that parses	and	filters	HTTP	traffic	from	a	browser	or	client	and	applies	a set	of	rules	before	the	traffic	is	allowed	to	proceed	to	the	actual application	server.	The	most	common	uses	for	a	WAF	are	to	find	and block	SQL	injection	and	cross-site	scripting	attacks	before	they	reach
an	application.

A	is	incorrect	because	an	XML	accelerator	is	an	appliance	designed	to offload	the	processing	of	XML	from	the	actual	applications	and systems	and	instead	leverage	optimized	and	dedicated	appliances designed	just	for	that	purpose.	In	most	instances,	especially	for	a heavily	used	application,	an	XML	accelerator	can	drastically	improve system	performance	and	provide	possible	security	benefits	as	well because	the	XML	processing	is	done	on	a	dedicated	resource,	away from	the	actual	application.	This	allows	for	the	parsing	and verification	of	inputs	and	values	before	the	actual	application	code	is hit,	much	in	the	same	way	as	an	XML	firewall.

C	is	incorrect	because	a	sandbox	is	a	concept	for	segregating	systems within	a	network	from	each	other	for	security,	regulatory,	or	testing requirements.

D	is	incorrect	because	a	firewall	is	used	to	control	network-level access	based	on	the	origination	and	destination	IP	address	as	well	as the	ports	and	protocols	used.	A	firewall	does	not	provide	the	ability	to inspect	the	actual	traffic	for	content,	such	as	a	SQL	injection	attempt.

### Question # 28 - A	federated	identity	system	is	composed	of	two	main	components.	Whichof	the	following	pairs	represents	the	correct	two	components?    
A.	Identity	provider	and	relying	party    
B.	Authentication	provider	and	service	provider    
C.	Identity	provider	and	relying	provider     
D.	Single	sign-on	and	application     
Answer: A.	

The	two	components	that	comprise	a	federated	identity	system	are the	identity	provider,	which	handles	the	authentication	and	release	of attributes	about	a	user,	and	the	relying	party,	which	accepts	the authentication	and	consumes	the	attributes	about	the	user,	typically then	making	them	available	to	an	application	or	service.

B	is	incorrect	because	although	authentication	provider	and	service provider	sound	similar	to	the	correct	terms,	and	in	some	cases	are	used in	the	same	manner	as	the	official	terms,	they	are	not	correct	in	this case.

C	is	incorrect	because	only	identity	provider	is	a	correct	term	for	one component.	The	other	component	is	the	relying	party;	it	consumes authentication	tokens	and	attributes	and	does	not	serve	as	a	provider
of	them.

D	is	incorrect	because	although	single	sign-on	and	application	do describe	to	some	extent	the	most	widespread	use	of	a	federated identity	system,	these	terms	are	not	universal	and	are	not	correct	in this	case.

### Question # 29 - Which	concept	involves	the	ability	for	a	system	to	respond	to	attack methods	being	used	against	it	and	automatically	alter	security configurations	and	countermeasures	to	compensate	for	them?      
A.	DAST    
B.	Pen    
C.	RASP    
D.	SAST    
Answer: C.	

Runtime	application	self-protection	(RASP)	involves	testing	against systems	that	have	the	capability	to	detect	attacks	and	threats	and	to automatically	adjust	their	security	settings	or	other	configurations	to compensate	for	and	mitigate	these	attacks	and	threats.	RASP	is designed	to	be	done	in	real	time	on	live	systems.

A	is	incorrect	because	dynamic	application	security	testing	(DAST)	is run	as	a	“black-box”	test	where	those	running	the	test	have	no	internal or	particular	knowledge	of	the	system	and	must	discover	everything they	know	about	it	through	the	use	of	utilities.	DAST	does	not	attempt to	fully	execute	malicious	actions	in	the	same	manner	as	pen	testing.

B	is	incorrect	because	pen	testing	is	done	as	a	“black-box”	test,	but using	the	same	tools	and	methodologies	that	an	attacker	would	use	in order	to	evaluate	the	security	of	the	application.	Pen	testing	is designed	to	assess	vulnerabilities	with	various	types	of	real-world scenarios	and	to	actually	execute	exploits.

D	is	incorrect	because	static	application	security	testing	(SAST)	tests both	the	source	code	and	the	components	of	an	application.	It	is	done as	a	“white-box”	test,	as	those	running	the	tests	have	full	access	to	the
actual	source	code	and	configuration	documentation	of	the application.	Also,	tests	are	run	against	an	offline	system.

### Question # 30 - What	type	of	testing	runs	known	attacks	and	signatures	against	a	systemto	determine	a	risk	rating	based	upon	discovered	weaknesses?     
A.	Vulnerability	scanning    
B.	Pen	testing    
C.	Baseline	scanning    
D.	Compliance	scanning    
Answer: A.	

Vulnerability	scanning	is	done	using	a	predefined	set	of	signatures and	parameters	to	evaluate	a	system	and	give	a	risk	rating	based	on	its findings.	It	does	not	have	extensive	knowledge	of	a	system	or	go beyond	the	preconfigured	tests	that	it	runs	for	compliance.

B	is	incorrect	because	pen	testing	is	done	as	a	“black-box”	test,	but using	the	same	tools	and	methodologies	that	an	attacker	would	use	in order	to	evaluate	the	security	of	the	application.	Pen	testing	is designed	to	access	vulnerabilities	with	various	types	of	real-world scenarios	and	to	actually	execute	exploits.

C	is	incorrect	because	baseline	scanning	is	done	to	confirm	that servers	and	systems	have	appropriately	and	correctly	applied	baseline configuration	requirements.	Baseline	scanning	does	not	test vulnerabilities	specifically;	instead,	it	is	solely	focused	on	ensuring baseline	compliance	and	flagging	any	deviations	for	remediation.

D	is	incorrect	because	compliance	scanning	can	refer	to	either	baseline scanning	or	scanning	to	ensure	that	server	configurations	and	policies are	in	place	to	meet	regulatory	requirements.	It	is	essentially	the	same as	baseline	scanning	in	most	cases	because	the	regulatory requirements	and	corporate	policies	will	form	the	basis	of	the baselines.

### Question # 31 - With	cloud	systems	making	exclusive	use	of	broad	network	access,	whichtechnology	is	commonly	used	for	support	personnel	to	access	systems	for maintenance	and	administration?    
A.	IPSec   
B.	TLS   
C.	SSH   
D.	VPN   
Answer: D.	

A	virtual	private	network	(VPN)	is	used	to	create	a	secure	network tunnel	from	outside	of	a	cloud	environment	into	the	internal	networks, and	in	many	instances	it’s	used	to	access	trusted	zones	that	are	not accessible	to	the	public.	VPNs	are	crucial	for	systems	support personnel	and	administrators	to	maintain	and	configure	servers.

A	is	incorrect	because	Internet	Protocol	Security	(IPSec)	is	used	to encrypt	packets	at	the	network	layer	between	two	hosts.	It	would	not be	used	to	provide	the	type	of	access	that	is	being	described	in	the question.

B	is	incorrect	because	TLS	is	an	encryption	method	that	would	likely be	used	in	conjunction	with	a	VPN,	but	it	does	not	inherently	present the	same	types	of	capabilities	or	features	that	administrators	would use	to	connect	from	the	outside	into	a	secure	internal	network.

C	is	incorrect	because	SSH	is	used	for	Secure	Shell	access	to	some operating	systems	and	could	be	used	in	conjunction	with	a	VPN,	but	it would	not	provide	the	network-level	access	into	a	secure	zone	in	the same	manner	as	a	VPN.

### Question # 32 - What	type	of	device	is	often	leveraged	to	assist	legacy	applications	thatmay	not	have	the	programmatic	capability	to	process	assertions	from modern	web	services?     
A.		Web	application	firewall    
B.	XML	accelerator  
C.	Relying	party   
D.	XML	firewall   
Answer: B.	

XML	accelerators	are	appliances	designed	to	offload	the	processing of	XML	from	the	actual	applications	and	systems	and	instead	leverage optimized	and	dedicated	appliances	designed	just	for	that	purpose.	In most	instances,	especially	for	a	heavily	used	application,	an	XML accelerator	can	drastically	improve	system	performance	and	provide possible	security	benefits	as	well	because	the	XML	processing	is	done on	a	dedicated	resource,	away	from	the	actual	application.	This	allows for	the	parsing	and	verification	of	inputs	and	values	before	the	actual application	code	is	hit,	much	in	the	same	way	as	an	XML	firewall. This	is	particularly	useful	in	situations	where	enterprise	applications might	not	be	designed	or	equipped	to	handle	the	typical	XML assertions	and	web	services	traffic	that	cloud	applications	often	use, and	it	can	provide	for	integration	without	the	need	for	complete application	changes	or	coding.

A	is	incorrect	because	a	web	application	firewall	(WAF)	is	designed for	parsing	incoming	web	requests	for	security	concerns	or	filtering based	on	many	different	aspects	of	the	requests.	Although	a	WAF
could	be	used	for	some	validation	of	XML	code,	it	would	not	be helpful	in	processing	XML	or	assisting	applications	in	doing	so.

C	is	incorrect	because	a	relying	party	is	part	of	a	federated	identity system	and	consumes	security	assertions	from	an	identity	provider	and then	processes	the	attributes	contained	within	them.	A	relying	party	is not	used	to	process	XML	for	applications	or	to	validate	it.

D	is	incorrect	because	XML	firewalls	are	commonly	used	to	validate incoming	XML	code	before	it	reaches	the	actual	application.	They	are typically	deployed	in	line	between	the	firewall	and	application	server, and	as	such,	traffic	will	pass	through	them	before	hitting	the application.	An	XML	firewall	can	validate	data	that	is	incoming,	as well	as	provide	granular	controls	for	what	systems	and	users	can access	the	XML	interfaces.

### Question # 33 - At	which	phase	of	the	SDLC	process	should	security	begin	participating?     
A.	Requirements	gathering    
B.	Requirements	analysis    
C.	Design    
D.	Testing   
Answer: A.	

Because	the	requirements-gathering	phase	is	the	earliest	phase, when	the	crucial	decisions	will	be	made	that	will	drive	and	dictate every	phase	thereafter,	it	is	vital	to	include	security	from	this	earliest point.	By	including	security	from	the	beginning,	an	organization	can ensure	that	proper	security	controls	and	designs	are	being implemented,	thus	lessening	the	change	of	having	to	redo	parts	of	the project	later	or	incurring	significant	loss	of	time	or	money	addressing security	concerns.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	requirements	analysis	occurs	after	vital	early decisions	have	been	already	made,	which	should	include	security.
C	is	incorrect	because	the	design	phase	occurs	after	requirements	have been	defined	and	many	key	decisions	have	been	made;	it	is	too	far along	to	include	security.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	testing	phase	occurs	after	the	project	has been	defined	and	implemented.	Although	including	security	in	testing is	certainly	vital,	it	is	far	too	late	in	the	process	for	security	to	be involved	and	it	drastically	increases	the	likelihood	of	security	gaps occurring	and	additional	time	and	money	being	necessary	to	address those	gaps.

### Question # 34 - Which	of	the	following	is	NOT	part	of	the	OWASP	Top	Ten	list	of	critical web	application	security	risks?    
A.	Injection    
B.	Sensitive	data	exposure    
C.	Insecure	direct	object	references     
D.	User	ID	and	password	authentication	schemes    
Answer: D.	

User	ID	and	password	authentication	schemes	are	not	a	specific component	of	the	OWASP	Top	Ten	list	of	critical	web	application security	risks.	Many	other	components	will	incorporate	threats	to authentication	schemes	and	systems,	but	the	list	does	not	treat	them	as their	own	entity.

A	is	incorrect	because	injection	is	a	specific	component	of	the	list.	An injection	attack	is	where	a	malicious	actor	sends	commands	or	other arbitrary	data	through	input	and	data	fields	with	the	intent	of	having the	application	or	system	execute	the	code	as	part	of	its	normal processing	and	queries.	This	can	trick	an	application	into	exposing data	that	is	not	intended	or	authorized,	or	potentially	allow	an	attacker to	gain	insight	into	configurations	or	security	controls.

B	is	incorrect	because	sensitive	data	exposure	is	a	specific	component of	the	list.	Sensitive	data	exposure	occurs	when	protected	information, such	as	PII	or	credit	card	information,	is	not	properly	encrypted	or masked,	and	is	thus	susceptible	to	attackers.	This	refers	to	specific data	within	the	application	and	is	not	directly	related	to	specific functions	of	the	application.

C	is	incorrect	because	insecure	direct	object	references	are	a	specific component	of	the	list.	Insecure	direct	object	references	occur	when	a developer	has	in	their	code	a	reference	to	something	on	the	application side,	such	as	a	database	key,	the	directory	structure	of	the	application, configuration	information	about	the	hosting	system,	or	any	other information	that	pertains	to	the	workings	of	the	application	that	should not	be	exposed	to	users	or	the	network.

### Question # 35 - What	type	of	identity	system	allows	trust	and	verifications	between	theauthentication	systems	of	multiple	organizations?    
A.	Federated    
B.	Collaborative    
C.	Integrated    
D.	Bidirectional    
Answer: A.	

Federated	identity	systems	work	by	allowing	an	identity	provider	at a	user’s	organization	to	be	trusted	by	relying	parties	connected	to applications	and	services	for	authentication	and	then	providing appropriate	authorization	based	on	attributes	released	from	the identity	provider.

B	is	incorrect	because	federated	is	the	correct	term	for	the	question, not	collaborative.
C	is	incorrect	because	federated	is	the	correct	term	for	the	question, not	integrated.
D	is	incorrect	because	federated	is	the	correct	term	for	the	question, not	bidirectional.

### Question # 36 - It	is	vital	during	the	initial	requirements	gathering	for	a	new	project	orapplication	to	include	all	the	pertinent	stakeholders	who	will	both	drive the	requirements	and	determine	whether	the	critical	success	factors	have been	achieved.	Which	of	the	following	would	NOT	be	a	key	stakeholder to	include	during	these	initial	stages?   
A.	Developers   
B.	Management    
C.	Security    
D.	Users   
Answer: A.	

During	the	requirements-gathering	stage,	developers	are	not typically	included.	Before	a	project	reaches	the	developers,	a	detailed plan	must	be	developed	to	define	the	project,	what	constitutes	success, and	what	the	specific	requirements	are	before	developers	are consulted.	In	many	instances,	the	specific	requirements	of	the	project may	even	define	who	the	developers	will	be	based	on	skillsets, expertise,	and	chosen	technologies	and	budgets.

B	is	incorrect	because	management	will	be	the	key	driver	of	any project	and	must	always	be	included	at	all	stages,	but	especially	at	the initial	stages	of	requirements	gathering	and	project	scoping.
C	is	incorrect	because	security	should	always	be	included	from	the very	beginning	stages	of	any	project	and	development	planning	to ensure	things	are	done	in	a	secure	manner.	Without	the	early involvement	of	security,	the	risk	is	greatly	increased	of	substantial extra	costs	or	having	to	redo	parts	of	the	project	later.
D	is	incorrect	because	the	involvement	of	the	ultimate	users	of	the system,	or	users	of	similar	or	previous	systems,	can	give	invaluable insight	into	a	development	project	and	will	be	the	determinants	of	the ultimate	success	or	failure	of	the	project.

### Question # 37 - The	Simple	Object	Access	Protocol	(SOAP)	allows	programs	fromdifferent	environments	or	platforms	to	communicate	seamlessly	with	each other	over	HTTP.	If	you	are	using	SOAP,	which	data	format	are	you	using for	information	exchange?    
A.	SAML   
B.	XML    
C.	JSON    
D.	HTML    
Answer: B.	

The	SOAP	protocol	exclusively	uses	the	Extensible	Markup Language	(XML)	for	its	data	encoding	and	information	exchange.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	Security	Assertion	Markup	Language (SAML)	is	used	for	federated	identity	systems	to	exchange authentication/authorization	information	and	attributes	about	a	user, but	it	is	not	used	with	the	SOAP	protocol.
C	is	incorrect	because	although	JavaScript	Object	Notation	(JSON)	is a	widely	used	human-readable	data	format,	it	is	not	used	by	the	SOAP protocol.
D	is	incorrect	because	although	the	Hypertext	Markup	Language (HTML)	is	used	for	websites	and	web	applications	to	encode	data	for web	browsers	to	interpret,	it	is	not	used	by	the	SOAP	protocol.

### Question # 38 - Single	sign-on	systems	work	by	authenticating	users	from	a	centralizedlocation	or	using	a	centralized	method,	and	then	allowing	applications	that trust	the	system	to	grant	those	users	access.	What	would	be	passed between	the	authentication	system	and	the	applications	to	grant	a	user access?    
A.		Ticket   
B.	Certificate   
C.	Credential   
D.	Token   
Answer: D.	

Single	sign-on	systems	use	tokens	to	pass	authentication information	between	systems	that	can	be	trusted	to	allow	the	user access	and	to	confirm	their	identity.

A	is	incorrect	because	although	tickets	are	used	with	many	different types	of	systems,	this	is	not	the	correct	answer	to	the	question.
B	is	incorrect	because	although	certificates	may	be	used	with	some systems	for	authentication,	they	are	not	then	passed	to	other	systems once	authenticated.
C	is	incorrect	because	credentials	are	used	to	verify	a	user	at	the authentication	source	but	are	not	passed	between	systems.
