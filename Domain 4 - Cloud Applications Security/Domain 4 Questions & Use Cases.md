- ❓# 106. Software that includes security elements from the outset of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) process will be _______________.

  		C. More likely to malfunction
		D. Less likely to malfunction
Answer:
A. It is important to verify and validate the program at each stage of the SDLC.
Adding functionality at each stage of the SDLC is the definition of scope creep, which is what we’d like to avoid. Option A is incorrect.
