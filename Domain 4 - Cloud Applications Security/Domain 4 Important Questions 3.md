Answer: A             

### Answers: Chapter 4: Domain 4: Cloud Application Security

Question # 1.	D. Mikayla can’t validate third-p arty software’s lack of vulnerabilities or other security issues simply by validating that it is signed, that its hash matches an officially posted hash, or that the checksum matches ensuring the file is intact. She’ll need to test the software herself or identify a third party that she can rely on that does appropriate software testing. Even then, the software could still contain flaws.

Question # 2.	C. Lin will need to provide authorization to use her organization’s services. The third- party identity provider will supply user IDs and will authenticate them, then provide Lin with a token or validation that the user is who they claim to be. Identity proofing is not necessarily provided by either party in this scenario, which can make accepting third- party credentials challenging if verifying that someone is who they claim to be is important instead of just allowing access to the service.

Question # 3.	D. Joanna knows she can’t access the source code meaning that static analysis isn’t an option, and that identifying secrets may be difficult.

Question # 4.	A. The Agile development model is most frequently associated with cloud services and development. Rapid application development, spiral, and waterfall methods are more frequently associated with traditional development environments but can be used for cloud services and systems.

Question # 5.	D. Susan knows that cloud services will allow her to build her applications on reliable, scalable infrastructure that can leverage redundancy in multiple ways. She also knows that securing code remains a concern regardless of the environment that it is built or run in.

Question # 6.	C. Susan knows that encryption in transit, typically via TLS, is the right solution to prevent third parties from intercepting and accessing data that is sent to her customers via API calls. Tokenization and masking are used to protect data in applications, but they do not meet the need to prevent interception, and the data will be in transit rather than at rest in the scenario described.

Question # 7.	B. Brainstorming, surveys, workshops, user observation, and many other techniques are commonly used to gather business requirements. Documentation, however, doesn’t involve user requirements or feedback.

Question # 8.	B. Since multiple tenants share the same underlying infrastructure, encryption at rest provides protection against inadvertent data exposure or remnant data on reused infrastructure. Elasticity, measured services, and scalability do not require encryption at rest and may in fact result in slightly higher costs due to encryption overhead.

Question # 9.	C. Having multiple deployment paths means that elements or processes in a CI/CD system can be avoided. A single path with an emergency process backing it up helps to avoid this problem. Automation, use of metrics, and using version control are all recommended best practices for CI/CD pipelines.

Question # 10.	C. Maria knows that IdPs typically integrate with either OpenID Connect or SAML. OpenLDAP is an open source implementation of LDAP, but it isn’t used for this type of integration since it is a directory service. ConnectID and IDPL were made up for this question.

Question # 11.	A. Jack knows that languages that best fit cloud applications make the most sense and that assembly language isn’t likely to fit his CI/CD environment. Use of automated release pipelines, containers, and microservices are all common elements in cloud application development and design.

Question # 12.	A. While some development models allow for user involvement in the entirety of the process, user input is most necessary in the Define phase, where developers can understand the business/user requirements— what the system/software is actually supposed to produce, in terms of function and performance. Involvement throughout the process is helpful, but without user input in Define, the entire process won’t have the right starting point.

Question # 13.	A. Brian needs to bring up regulatory compliance during the Requirements Gathering phase of the SDLC. If it isn’t a requirement, it won’t make it into the design and implementation. Testing for regulatory compliance can be challenging as not all compliance can be tested for by technical means.

Question # 14.	A. Angie is using a white box, or full knowledge, testing methodology. Gray box, or partial knowledge, testing provides some but not all access to an environment or system. Black box, or zero knowledge, testing requires testers to act like attackers without insider knowledge of the systems. Red box was made up for this question.

Question # 15.	C. KMSs, or key management services, are used to securely store and access secrets, allowing them to be used when needed without hard- coding them. TPMs are used to store secrets for hardware devices, MFA tokens are used for multifactor authentication, and API keys are used to securely authenticate to and access APIs, but none of them provide the functionality needed to avoid hard- coded credentials in cloud applications.

Question # 16.	A. A software bill of materials (SBOM) is used to identify each component in a software package. Dana knows that having a SBOM will help her to track the versions and updates available for each component of her software stack.

Question # 17.	A. API gateways are designed to aggregate API access, provide authentication for API use, rate- limit, and gather statistics and data about API usage. API proxies are used to decouple software components, API firewalls are purpose- built firewalls for APIs that protect specific APIs, and next- generation API managers were made up for this question.

Question # 18.	B. Interactive application security testing (IAST) uses software instrumentation to monitor applications as they run and to gather information about what occurs and how the software performs. It is normally implemented during the QA or Testing phase of the SDLC.

Question # 19.	B. Unsecured APIs are a common issue, and lack of authentication is a major problem. 
How data is provided— structured, unstructured, or semi- structured— is not a security issue. Encryption is typically not provided by the API and is instead provided by the web server or underlying service.

Question # 20.	B. AES- 256 is a commonly accepted and used standard for encryption of data at rest. TLS is used for encryption in transit. SSL is outmoded, and Blowfish has known vulnerabilities including birthday attacks.

Question # 21.	C. Checking whether included software is internally or externally developed is a  best practice, and only checking your own components will often leave a lot  of unchecked software in a package. You can find the full list at www.nist 
.gov/itl/executive-order-improving-nations-cybersecurity/ recommended-minimum-standard-vendor-or-developer.

Question # 22.	B. Lori’s best option is to conduct a software composition analysis (SCA) process using an SCA tool that can identify open source libraries and other components. Vulnerability scans won’t identify all of the components associated with software, and a version number validation process was made up for this question.

Question # 23.	A. Christine is preparing for abuse case testing, which documents abuse of software functionality. Static testing reviews source code, QA testing validates the quality of software, and SCA is software composition analysis, which looks at underlying components of software.

Question # 24.	B. ASVS is intended to be used as a metric to assess the degree of trust that can be placed in web applications, to provide guidance to developers on how to build in security controls, and 
as part of procurement processes to specify application security validation requirements in contracts. It isn’t designed as an audit standard.

Question # 25.	A. The OWASP Top 10 is a cloud- specific list, whereas the SANS Top 25 describes software errors in general. The NIST Dirty Dozen and the MITRE ATT&CK- RS were made up for this question.

Question # 26.	D. Major.minor.patch is a common format for versioning. While there’s no industry standard, having the versioning numbers in an order of scale is a common practice.

Question # 27.	B. A software bill of materials (SBOM) is a listing of all of the components of a software package or program, and it is considered increasingly important as part of a software security program.

Question # 28.	B. Web application firewalls (WAFs) typically have built- in protection against common attacks like SQL injection. Valerie should choose a WAF to protect against both the SQL injection she’s aware of and other common attacks against web applications.

Question # 29.	B. Containers allow applications to be moved easily because they contain the dependencies and components the application needs without requiring a complete operating system to be packaged with them. Packages are software components, and virtual machines run on hypervisors.

Question # 30.	B. Charles is using a single sign- on (SSO) technology to allow him to log in once and use many services and systems. SAML and OpenID Connect are used for federation, while OTP is a one- time password.

Question # 31.	A. Henry’s organization should use API keys to ensure that only authorized users are able to use the APIs that they expose for customer use.

Question # 32.	A. Nancy knows that she should keep track of the license term, or how long the license is valid for, so that the software does not disable itself when the license or contract expires. The cost, whether the terms can be disclosed, and if there is third- party software involved are less likely to be the cause of service interruptions.

Question # 33.	B. FIPS 140- 2, a Federal Information Processing Standard, defines the requirements for cryptographic modules and is a commonly used standard to assess cryptographic systems, and it’s the only currently valid cryptographic standard listed here. SSL is outdated and has been replaced by TLS, SHA-2  is a hashing algorithm, and GDPR is a European Union data protection regulation.

Question # 34.	C. Using dynamic secrets— secrets that are generated and used as they are needed— allows for granular auditing of uses because each secret is created as needed and thus their specific usage can be reviewed as needed. Shared accounts don’t allow auditing because actions cannot be provably linked to individual users. Multifactor authentication helps prevent stolen credential and brute- force attacks but won’t increase the auditability of usage, and API keys allow API authentication, but like multifactor authentication, don’t increase the individual auditability of usage as much as dynamic secrets do.

Question # 35.	D. Testing the performance and security of software is expected in the Testing phase of the SDLC. The version, complexity, and size of the code are not commonly tested elements.

Question # 36.	A. Chris should look for a key management service (KMS). KMSs allow creation, storage, management, and auditing of keys. A PKI is a public key infrastructure, a CA is a certificate authority, and a KCS was made up for this question— none of them will provide the services that Chris is looking for.

Question # 37.	A. Identity providers (IdPs) provide authentication as well as create, manage, and maintain identities and identity information. Relying parties and service providers both trust IdPs to handle authentication, and SSO is single sign- on.

Question # 38.	C. Docker is a containerization tool.

Question # 39.	D. Yasmine knows that in an SaaS environment the vendor is responsible for the applications, data storage, runtime and middleware, operating systems and servers, storage, and networking. Yasmine’s company will be responsible for how they operate the software, who they provide access to, and what rights they provide to their users, as well as ensuring that her data is safe and secure.

Question # 40.	B. Multifactor authentication relies on using two different types of factors: something you know, like a password or PIN; something you have, like a hardware token or application- generated PIN; or something you are, such as a biometric identifier. Jason knows that a password and an app- generated PIN counts as using multiple factors.

Question # 41.	C. Git provides version management as part of its capabilities. Jenkins is a CI/CD tool used for continuous integration tooling. Puppet and Chef are both infrastructure automation tools.

Question # 42.	A. Ramon’s organization is using Azure’s federation capability to leverage their existing on- site credentials in the cloud. Structured, shared, and constrained identity were made up for this question.

Question # 43.	D. Having a complete software inventory allows organizations like Gretchen’s to ensure that they are aware of their software license compliances, terms, and conditions as well as their license expiration dates. While only using open source software might seem like an easy solution, there are multiple open source software licenses that have different requirements, making a software inventory necessary. Using only commercial software doesn’t simplify the requirement, and software versioning is important but would be part of a complete inventory.

Question # 44.	A. DREAD has been replaced with STRIDE by Microsoft. PASTA and ATASM are in active use.

Question # 45.	A. CASBs are often used to control usage based on roles and rights, but they aren’t used to monitor based on costs in the cloud service itself— instead, cost limiting rules are often used in the cloud services themselves. They are also used to limit the potential for sensitive data loss and to detect anomalous usage patterns.

Question # 46.	C. Kathleen knows that sandboxing, or creating a secure and isolated environment, is commonly used for malicious software testing. An IPS or antivirus can be used to detect malicious activities and might be deployed in the sandbox as part of the instrumentation. A SIEM solution is used to centralize and correlate security events and information.

Question # 47.	A. Using the CASB to enforce encryption between an on- premises location and cloud providers will provide the most effective protection against third parties seeing the data in transit. Tokenization and masking help protect data while it is being accessed but don’t prevent it from being exposed in transit. Upload prevention doesn’t prevent downloads from being accessed.

Question # 48.	A. Containers contain elements of the operating system but share the host’s kernel. They also contain libraries, configuration files, and the application files or binaries themselves.

Question # 49.	A. API keys should be unique, random, and non- guessable to ensure that attackers cannot guess or otherwise identify them.

Question # 50.	C. Ian can filter based on user identity and the service the users are attempting to use to most effectively filter service usage by role. Activity and data don’t identify the user, and activities don’t necessarily uniquely identify a service.

Question # 51.	A. **ATASM considers architecture, threats, attack surfaces (not attacks) and mitigations**.

Question # 52.	A. Testing done against running code is called dynamic testing. Static testing reviews source code. Automatic and structured testing are not commonly used testing terms.

Question # 53.	D. WAFs focus on web traffic and thus typically scan HTTP traffic rather than BGP, ICMP, or SMTP traffic.

Question # 54.	B. **The Design phase allows Henry to include security design elements that will help ensure that his application is secure**. 
The Requirements phase should include the need for security but won’t specify how it will be accomplished, and deployment and maintenance are too late as the architecture has already been designed and implemented.

Question # 55.	C. **A sandbox can be used to run malware for analysis purposes as it won’t affect (or infect) the production environment**; it’s worth noting, though, that some malware is sandbox- aware, so additional antimalware measures are advisable. Optimizing production by moving tasks isn’t a typical use for a sandbox, remote secure access systems are called jumpboxes, and subnets are created using network configurations.

Question # 56.	B. Containerization best meets the platform- agnostic approach that matches Valerie’s requirements. While serverless is powerful, moving between native serverless platforms typically requires building to each provider’s requirements. Virtual machines have more overhead than Valerie needs, and not configuring them for the application only makes them less suited to the task.

Question # 57.	D. **A Database Activity Monitor (DAM) solution provides database activity monitoring that includes** 
  **privileged account usage logging and monitoring 
  in addition to other security and monitoring feature**s. 
A WAF would help with web application security issues but doesn’t meet the need described here. DB- IPS and database SIEMs were made up for this question.

Question # 58.	D. Requiring authentication and setting throttling limits and quotas help to prevent denial- of- service attacks on APIs. Scalable architecture can help handle the load but won’t stop the attacks from occurring, and using an IPS might help stop attacks but an API gateway would be more likely to understand API traffic.

Question # 59.	C. Software that has either been purchased from a vendor or developed internally can be tested in a sandboxed environment that mimics the production environment in order to determine whether there will be any interoperability problems when it is installed into actual production. It isn’t used for user awareness or regulatory requirement evaluation or API security testing in most cases.

Question # 60.	C. FIPS 140- 2 is a U.S. government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules. If the module Jen is using is FIPS 140- 2-certified, she will have met her goal. PCI compliance is used for credit cards, AES is not a certification, and GLBA is a U.S. act that requires financial institutions to secure their customers private information.

[important] Question # 61.	B. **Rotating secrets limits the blast radius of exposed or compromised secrets**. 
Extending their lifecycle does the opposite and means they can have a longer lifecycle in the hands of attackers. 
Replacing secrets with tokens won’t meet the needs of most service environments. 
While certificate revocation lists (CRLs) exist, secret expiration lists do not.

Question # 62.	B. Olivia is conducting functional testing that seeks to test whether software meets business requirements. This does not specify a load or stress test scenario.

Question # 63.	C. SMS factors are considered the least secure of these options because of SIM swapping and VoIP- based attacks on SMS messages.

Question # 64.	C. Review of the source code is static testing and does not meet Ben’s needs. The other answers all include dynamic testing options.

Question # 65.	B. **CAPTCHA- based security systems help to reduce the impact of bots by requiring human interaction**. 
**While there are ways to work around CAPTCHAs, Yariv knows that they require additional work from attackers and will help reduce the overall load from bots**. SQL injection and XSS are not mentioned in the question, and requiring logins without additional protections will not help.

Question # 66.	D. When Emily logs in using her Google credentials, Google acts as the identity provider and tells the third- party service provider that she has logged in using her user ID and passwords successfully. The service provider must then authorize her to use services. Nothing in the question indicates whether the service provider may be a storage provider.

Question # 67.	D. Not all programs (or organizations) will require database access, or even use databases, and hashing is not a common requirement since the data will not be readable. Encryption at rest and in transit, as well as data masking, are all commonly employed to protect sensitive information.

Question # 68.	C. **SAML is an XML- based protocol, and Kristen knows that an XML firewall that is SAML-aware with appropriate rules for identity- based protection would be her best option**. 
IDS systems cannot rate- limit even if they are SAML-aware. WAFs are designed for web applications rather than specifically for XML and SAML- based filtering, and a DAM is a database- specific tool.

Question # 69.	C. Using SSO does not prevent the use of multifactor authentication. In fact, it often makes it easier since organizations can centralize their use of MFA.

Question # 70.	D. Static testing reviews source code. Dynamic testing would test outcomes and performance.

Question # 71.	B. **Biometric readers are the least likely secondary factor to be supported by cloud vendors. Hardware and software tokens as well as SMS factors are commonly supported by cloud providers**.

Question # 72.	D. **Once planning is done, organizations typically move into the Requirements Gathering phase to ensure that they know what the software they will build will do. 
Design, Build, Test, Deploy, and Maintain are common follow- up phases**.

Question # 73.	B. **Waterfall phases each serve as the input for the next phase and move only in one direction**.

Question # 74.	B. Requirements are typically mapped to the software in the Design phase. Requirements will be created in the Define phase, validated in the Test phase, and of course the software will be run in production in the Operations phase.

Question # 75.	D. **Nonfunctional testing seeks to test to meet customer expectations and performance requirements, including how software behaves under abnormal conditions**. 
Black box, or zero knowledge, testing attempts to replicate an attacker’s experience; 
white box, or full knowledge, testing provides complete insight into an environment or tool, including access to source code and documentation, 
and functional testing is conducted based on business requirements.

Question # 76.	D. **Since there are a number of different open source licenses, Gabriel’s best bet is to ensure that his organization reviews the licenses that apply to each software package or component they use. This can be complex and time-consuming, and organizations often limit the licenses they are willing to accept to reduce this burden**.

Question # 77.	B. **Injection, distributed denial- of- service, cross- site scripting, on- path, and credential stuffing attacks are all commonly aimed at APIs**. Malware attacks, however, are not a common API threat.

Question # 78.	B. **The SAFECode fundamental practices note that errors should be handled in a secure and graceful way**. 
**It recommends against** providing too much information in errors and that unanticipated errors should be flagged to both users and administrators but with different levels of information appropriate to each group.

Question # 79.	C. **Jason should use a commercial certificate authority for any certificate used in production**. 
This allows users to validate the certificate and the certificate chain to ensure trust.

Question # 80.	B. A signature ensures that the file is both the correct file and that it has not been changed, and validates that it was provided by the signer. An SHA2 hash is the second-best option, although attackers might modify the hash on the site or modify the file before it is hashed. File size and version number are the least useful options.

Question # 81.	A. Interactive application security testing **(IAST) uses software instrumentation to validate performance and function and is typically conducted during the QA/Test phase of the SDLC**. 
SCA or software composition analysis reviews the components that make up an application. 
Interactive and structured DST were made up for this question.

Question # 82.	A. **Changing encryption algorithms if a problem is found with one that is currently in use is actually a best practice that SAFECode recommends**. **They call it “cryptographic agility”** and note that you need to be able to transition to new mechanisms, libraries, and keys when needed. 
**Defining what to protect, what mechanisms will be used, and how keys and certificates will be managed are all common best practices and are also recommended by SAFECode**.

Question # 83.	A. In a PaaS environment, the customer is responsible for the security of applications in the production environment. The service provider will be responsible for the underlying hardware and platform itself.

Question # 84.	A. Abuse case testing will test how users could abuse the software, including the type of issues James is concerned about. White box, or full knowledge, testing and black box, or zero knowledge, testing both describe the amount of information that testers have about the environment, and use case testing validates how software is supposed to be used, not how it could be abused.

Question # 85.	D. Active Directory, SAML, and vendor- native SSO options are all commonly supported, but LDAP is not a commonly supported SSO option for most cloud vendors.

[knowledge important] Question # 86.	A. **In the Define phase, organizations work to determine the purpose of the software** and **what it needs to do to meet the needs of users**. **Design and Development stages** then work **to architect and build software** that meets those requirements. 
**Detect is not an SDLC phase**.

[important knowledge] Question # 87.	C. **Setting a nonprivileged user as the process owner will work in many cases**. 
**Setting the container owner as a nonprivileged user won’t stop root from running it in a poor configuration**. 
**Limiting root login or requiring multifactor won’t stop a process from running as root either**.

Question # 88.	A. **Jessica should perform static testing to help her organization identify code quality issues by reviewing the source code** for the application. 
Dynamic testing can identify functional issues but may not identify code quality or business logic flaws. 
**Black box testing won’t allow the access to the code she needs**, 
and **software composition analysis seeks to understand what components make up an application**.

Question # 89.	B. The STRIDE threat model does not deal with business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) actions. All the other options are elements of STRIDE: escalation of privilege, repudiation, and spoofing.

Question # 90.	D. **API gateways are well suited to this type of architecture because they focus on service discovery and API security as well as rate- limiting and other security controls like authentication**. 
XML firewalls and cloud application security brokers (CASBs) are both used for other purposes, and RPC gateways allow remote procedure calls to other networks and services.

Question # 91.	A. The earlier security inputs are included in the project, the more efficient and less costly security controls are overall. The Define phase is the earliest part of the SDLC, and thus is when security staff should be included.

Question # 92.	A. **Tahir is conducting a nonfunctional test that checks for behavior under load and since the program is actually running, it is dynamic testing rather than static testing of source code**.

Question # 93.	B. **Joanna is using a single sign- on (SSO) infrastructure to allow her to sign on in one location and to use those credentials in multiple locations with various service providers**. 
RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is used for graphical access to Windows systems, OTP is a one- time password, and MFA is multifactor authentication.

Question # 94.	A. **Tampering impacts the integrity of data by modifying it**.

Question # 95.	C. OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project, provides both cloud and web application security top 10 lists that are community sourced and which are well suited to awareness training. ASVS sets standards for application validation and security testing. CVE and NIST are not community- based web application security guides.

Question # 96.	D. **Interactive application security testing (IAST) would be most likely to occur during the Testing phase of the SDLC**.

Question # 97.	C. **Using automated creation tools for passphrases will prevent staff members from reusing passwords or falling into habits that result in easily guessed passphrases and password**s. 
Using a word list, shared passphrases, or simply adding complexity will not meet Malika’s needs.

Question # 98.	A. **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is commonly used to enable identity federation**. 
FIPS 140- 2 is a U.S. government encryption mechanism standard, XML may be needed but is a very broad standard for extensible markup languages, and FIM is federated identity management, a generic term describing the overall concept, not a technology or technological capability.

Question # 99.	C. Replicating production for QA testing, then promoting from QA to production once testing is complete, is a common design practice in application development environments. Adding software going through QA to production environments or allowing users to use QA systems instead of production can lead to a negative user experience, and creating a QA environment that doesn’t match production may invalidate testing.

Question # 100.	A. ASVS uses a three- level code validation assurance level model, with level 3 requiring critical applications to meet in- depth validation and testing requirements.
