# ANSWERS - Comprehensive	Answers	and	Explanations

### Question # 1 - 	Data	centers	 have	components	that	are 	either	internal	or	external redundancies.	Which	of	the	following	is	considered	an	internal.  redundancy?  
A.	Generators. 
B.	Power	feeds. 
C.	Power	distribution	units. 
D.	Building	access	points. 
Answer: C.	

Power 	distribution	units	are	internal	to	a	data	center.	
They	distribute power	to	racks,	internal	chillers,	and	any	other	internal	systems	that need	direct	power	feeds.	
Because	they	are	completely	internal	to	the data	center,	they	are	considered	an	internal	redundancy.

A	is	incorrect	 because	generators	are	external	to	a	data	center	and provide	electrical	feeds	in	the	event	of	a 	utility	outage.
Because 	they sit	outside	of	the	data	center	and	feed	power	inward,	they	are considered	an	external	redundancy.

B	is	incorrect	 because	power	feeds	come	from	external	utilities	 or generators	 and	send	electrical	power	into	the	data	center.	
Because	 they originate	from	outside	 the 	data	center,	they	are	considered	external redundancies.

D	is	incorrect 	because	 building 	access	points	provide 	staff	access	to internal	layers	of	a	data	center	from	the	outside.	Because	they	provide external	 access	to	the	data	center,	they	are	considered	external redundancies.

### Question # 2 - Limits	 within	a	cloud	environment	can	 be 	either	hard	limits	or	limits capable	of	adjusting 	to	current	demands	 and	circumstances.	Which	of	the following 	concepts	encapsulates 	allowing	a	limit to	adjust	to	current circumstances,	without	 the	actual	limit	 value	changing?       
A.	Loaning.    
B.	Borrowing.     
C.	Adapting.     
D.	Scaling.     
Answer: B.    

Limits	can	be	set	as	either	hard	or	flexible	within	a	cloud environment.	When	limits	are	flexible,	rather	than	adjusting	 the	actual limits	when	it	is	necessary	to	exceed	them,	the	system	allows customers	 or	other	systems	to	borrow	resources,	which 	are	allocated to	the	customer	or	system	in	need.	
This	maintains 	the	 actual	 limit	in the	system	going	forward,	but	allows	for	temporary	expansion 	under certain	circumstances.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	correct	term	is	borrowing,	not	loaning.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	correct	term	is	borrowing,	not	adapting.  		

D	is	incorrect	because	the	correct	term	is	borrowing,	not	scaling.

### Question # 3 - When	 dealing	 with	 a	cloud	 environment	that	has	resource	pooling	and multitenancy,	a	cloud	 customer	 may	want	contractual	assurances	that sufficient	resources	 to	start 	and	 operate	their	services	will	always	be available.	What	is	this	type	of	assurance 	called?       
A.	Limit.         
B.	Reservation.          
C.	Share.          
D.	Guarantee.            
Answer: B.   

A	reservation	is	a 	minimum	 resource 	level	guaranteed	to	a	customer within	a	cloud	environment.
A	reservation	can	 pertain	to	the	two	 main aspects	 of	computing:	memory	and	processing.	With	a	reservation	in place,	a	cloud	customer	is	guaranteed	by	the	cloud	provider	to	always have	at	minimum	the	necessary	resources	 available	to	power	on	and operate	 any	of	its	 services.	
In	large	 cloud	environments	with numerous	customers,	this	feature	 can	be	of	particular	importance	in the	case	of	denial	of	service	attacksv	or	high	utilization	of	resources 	by other 	hosts	 and	systems	because	it	offers	a	guaranteed	 minimum	 level of	operations	to	all	customers.

A	is	incorrect	because	limits	are	put	in	place	to	enforce	the	maximum allowable	utilization	of	memory	or	processing	by	a	cloud	customer. These	limits	can	be	done	at	either	the	virtual	machine	level	or	a comprehensive	level	for	a	customer.	They	are	meant	to	ensure	that enormous	cloud	resources	cannot	be	allocated	to	or	consumed	by	a single	host	or	customer	to	the	detriment	of	other	hosts	and	customers.
Along	with	cloud	computing	features	such	as	auto-scaling	and	ondemand	self-service,	limits	can	be	either	hard	(or	fixed)	or	flexible and	allowed	to	change	dynamically.	Typically,	when	limits	are allowed	to	change	dynamically	based	on	current	conditions	and consumption,	it	is	done	by	“borrowing”	additional	resources	rather through	a	change	to	the	actual	limits	themselves.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	concept	of	shares	within	a	cloud environment	is	used	to	mitigate	and	control	customer	requests	for resource	allocations	in	case	the	environment	does	not	have	the	current capability	to	provide	the	needed	resources.	Shares	work	by prioritizing	hosts	within	a	cloud	environment	through	a	weighting system	that	is	defined	by	the	cloud	provider.	When	periods	of	high utilization	and	allocation	are	reached,	the	system	automatically	uses the	scoring	of	each	host	based	on	its	share	value	to	determine	which hosts	get	access	to	the	limited	resources	still	available.	The	higher	the value	a	particular	host	has,	the	more	resources	it	will	be	allowed	to utilize.

D	is	incorrect	because	although	the	term	guarantee	sounds	similar	in concept	to	reservation,	it	is	not	the	correct	term	being	asked	for	by	the question.

### Question # 4 - A	BCDR	plan	has	several	different	 types	of	operations	and 	major components.	Which	of	the	following	is	the 	most	often 	overlooked	part	of the	overall	process,	both	in	testing 	and 	in	planning?  
A.	Recovery	of	services. 
B.	Change	management 	processes. 
C.	Staff 	availability 	and 	demands. 
D.	Restoration	of	services. 
Answer: D.	

Once	a	BCDR	event	has	concluded,	and	the	regular	data	center	and hosting	resources	are	available	again,	it	is	crucial	to	conduct	an orderly	return	to	normal	operations.	Although	BCDR	plans	tend	to	be very	detailed	and	thoroughly	tested	for	moving	production	operations to	a	recovery	site,	the	same	level	of	detail	and	testing	is	often	not performed	for	returning	services	to	normal	operations.	With	this oversight,	an	organization	can	be	left	incurring	substantial	delays, costs,	or	even	potentially	downtime	returning	its	data	and	services	to their	normal	operating	state.
  
A	is	incorrect	because	the	recovery	of	services	during	a	disaster	tends to	be	the	overwhelming	focus	of	any	BCDR	plan	and	testing,	and	is not	something	that	would	be	overlooked	at	all.
 	
B	is	incorrect	because	most	BCDR	planning	does	a	good	job	of ensuring	that	change	management	processes	have	been	followed	to ensure	system	consistency	and	documentation,	and	these	processes	are not	typically	overlooked	during	planning	and	testing.
 	
C	is	incorrect	because	the	availability	of	staff	and	the	demands	placed upon	them	are	tightly	coupled	with	the	restoration	of	services,	and	as such	would	not	be	overlooked.

### Question # 5 - What	concept 	allows	users	 or	support 	staff	to	change	some	network configurations	without 	having	access	to	the	actual	networking	hardware and	administrative	interfaces?  
A.	Logical	networks. 
B.	VLANs. 
C.	Broad	network	access. 
D.	Software-defined	networking.  		
Answer: D.	

An	important	aspect	of	cloud	computing	is	the	use	of	softwaredefined	networking	(SDN).	With	SDN,	the	decisions	concerning where	traffic	is	filtered	or	sent	and	the	actual	forwarding	of	traffic	are completely	separate	from	each	other.	With	cloud	computing,	this separation	is	important	because	it	allows	the	administrators	of	the cloud	network	to	quickly	and	dynamically	adjust	network	flows	and resources	based	on	the	current	needs	and	demands	of	the	cloud customers.	With	the	separation	from	the	actual	network	components,	a cloud	provider	can	build	management	tools	that	allow	staffers	using web	portals	or	cloud	administrative	interfaces	to	make	changes	to	the network	without	having	to	log	into	the	actual	network	components	or have	the	command	knowledge	of	a	network	administrator	to	make changes.	With	the	level	of	access	provided	and	the	types	of	resources available	to	control,	a	high	level	of	security	needs	to	be	attached	to any	SDN	implementation,	with	access	tightly	controlled	and monitored	regularly.
 	
A	is	incorrect	because	logical	networks	are	a	concept	that	involves	the separation	and	segregation	of	network	IP	spaces	within	a	larger physical	network,	but	it	does	not	pertain	to	the	administration	of
networks	or	granting	of	administrative	access.
 	
B	is	incorrect	because	virtual	local	area	networks	(VLANs)	are	the same	concept	as	logical	networks,	where	a	network	is	broken	up	into different	segments	within	a	larger	physical	network,	but	it	does	not pertain	to	the	administration	of	networks.
 
C	is	incorrect	because	broad	network	access	refers	to	cloud	computing being	available	over	the	public	Internet	rather	than	using	the	internal or	private	networks	typically	associated	with	a	traditional	data	center, but	it	does	not	pertain	to	the	administration	of	networks.

### [important] Question # 6 - Within 	a	federated	 identity 	system,	which	 entity	 takes	 the	response	from the	 identity	 provider 	and	processes 	it	to	determine	 the	authentication 	and authorization	properties	of	the	user?  
A.	Service 	provider. 
B.	Service 	party.  
C.	Relying	 party. 
D.	Application	provider.  
Answer: C.	

**During	the 	authentication	 process,	the	identity	provider	sends certain	predetermined	attributes 	about	 the	user	to	the	relying	 party.** 
**The	relying 	party	then	uses	this	information	(name,	location,	job	title, and	so	on)	to	determine	 the	appropriate	level 	and	 type	of	access	to grant,	or	whether	to	grant	access	at	all.**
The	relying 	party,	even	in	a federated	system,	makes	 this	 determination	 because	it	is	tied	to	the actual	application,	and	it	makes 	the 	decisions	 based	on	the 	policies, requirements,	or	regulations	of	the	data	being	accessed.
 	
A	is	incorrect	because	service	provider,	although	it	is	often	used	in	the same	way	as	the	term	relying	party,	is	not	the	correct	term	that	is universally	used	in	this	case.
 	
B	is	incorrect	because	service	party	sounds	similar	to	the	term	relying party	but	is	not	the	correct	term	in	this	case.
 	
D	is	incorrect	because	application	provider	sounds	similar	to	the	term relying	party	but	is	not	the	correct	term	in	this	case.

### Question # 7 - 	Which	cloud	storage	method	utilizes	a	key	value	to	access	data	from	an application	or	client?  
A.	Object.  
B.	Volume.  
C.	Structured.  
D.	Unstructured.  
Answer: A.	

Object	storage	is	hosted	external	from	systems	and	applications	and is	accessed	via	a	key	value	for	each	object	that	it	stores.	It	is	not organized	in	a	directory	or	the	hierarchical	structure	of	a	file	system, but	rather	is	a	flat	structure	where	each	object	is	classified	with	an opaque	key	value.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	volume	storage	uses	the	same	traditional folders,	directories,	filenames,	and	structures	as	a	file	system	on	a regular	computer	or	server.	Although	it	could	use	filenames	that	look similar	to	key	values,	it	is	not	stored	or	accessed	in	the	same	manner as	object	storage.
 
C	is	incorrect	because	structured	storage	resembles	a	database paradigm,	with	defined	structures,	labels,	and	fields.	It	is	not	used	for general	object	types,	nor	does	it	use	key	values	in	the	same	sense	as object	storage.
 
D	is	incorrect	because	unstructured	storage	is	used	for	supporting	and auxiliary	files	in	conjunction	with	structured	storage,	but	it	does	not use	key	values	in	the	same	sense	as	object	storage	does.

### Question # 8 - Which	of	the	following 	is	the 	most	prominent	 potential	 problem	point	 with object	storage 	for	 systems	that	have	high	data	reading	 and	 writing dependencies?  
A.	Integrity	of	objects.   
B.	Replication	of	objects. 
C.	Size	of	objects. 
D.	Number	of	objects. 
Answer: B.	

Object	storage	systems	are	self-contained	and	external	from	a customer’s	servers	or	application	servers.	When	objects	are	written	to them,	there	is	a	potential	for	data	consistency	issues	until	the redundant	servers	have	received	the	replicated	data	objects.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	integrity	of	objects	is	not	a	concern specifically	related	to	applications	that	use	high	reading	or	writing dependencies.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	size	of	objects	is	not	a	specific	concern pertinent	to	the	question.	However,	the	larger	objects	will	take	longer
to	fully	replicate	and	could	become	an	issue	if	a	need	to	read	arises soon	after.	However,	with	the	root	of	the	problem	being	replication, the	best	answer	is	specifically	the	replication	of	objects.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	number	of	objects	is	not	a	specific	concern pertinent	to	the	question.	However,	a	larger	number	of	objects	will take	longer	to	fully	replicate	and	could	become	an	issue	if	a	need	to read	arises	soon	after.	However,	with	the	root	of	the	problem	being replication,	the	best	answer	is	specifically	the	replication	of	objects.  

### Question # 9 - When	system	resource	utilization	is	experiencing	heavy	demand,	possibly nearing	the	overall	full	capacity	of	the	cloud	environment,	which	of	the following	concepts	will	set	the	prioritization	as	to	which	virtual	hosts receive	the	requested	resources?   
A.	Reservations.  
B.	Shares.  
C.	Limits.  
D.	Escrows.  
Answer: B.	

The	concept	of	shares	within	a	cloud	environment	is	used	to mitigate	and	control	customer	requests	for	resource	allocations	in	case the	environment	does	not	have	the	current	capability	to	provide	these resources.	Shares	work	by	prioritizing	hosts	within	a	cloud environment	through	a	weighting	system	that	is	defined	by	the	cloud provider.	When	periods	of	high	utilization	and	allocation	are	reached, the	system	automatically	uses	the	scoring	of	each	host	based	on	its share	value	to	determine	which	hosts	get	access	to	the	limited resources	still	available.	The	higher	the	value	a	particular	host	has,	the more	resources	it	will	be	allowed	to	utilize.
 	
A	is	incorrect	because	a	reservation	is	a	minimum	resource	level	that	is guaranteed	to	a	customer	within	a	cloud	environment.	A	reservation can	pertain	to	the	two	main	aspects	of	computing:	memory	and processing.	With	a	reservation	in	place,	a	cloud	customer	is guaranteed	by	the	cloud	provider	to	always	have	at	minimum	the necessary	resources	available	to	power	on	and	operate	any	of	its services.	In	large	cloud	environments	with	a	large	number	of customers,	this	feature	can	be	of	particular	importance	in	the	case	of denial	of	service	attacks	or	high	utilization	of	resources	by	other	hosts and	systems	because	it	offers	a	guaranteed	minimum	level	of operations	to	all	customers.
  
C	is	incorrect	because	limits	are	put	in	place	to	enforce	maximum utilization	of	memory	or	processing	by	a	cloud	customer.	These	limits can	either	be	done	at	the	virtual	machine	level	or	a	comprehensive level	for	a	customer.	They	are	meant	to	ensure	that	enormous	cloud resources	cannot	be	allocated	or	consumed	by	a	single	host	or customer	to	the	detriment	of	other	hosts	and	customers.	Along	with cloud	computing	features	such	as	auto-scaling	and	on-demand	selfservice,	limits	can	be	either	hard	(or	fixed)	or	flexible	and	allowed	to change	dynamically.	Typically,	when	limits	are	allowed	to	change dynamically	based	on	current	conditions	and	consumption,	it	is	done by	“borrowing”	additional	resources	rather	than	through	a	change	in the	actual	limits	themselves.
 	
D	is	incorrect	because	escrows	sounds	similar	to	the	term	shares	but	is not	the	correct	term	in	this	case.

### Question # 10 - 	Which	concept	ensures	that	enough	resources	are	available	to	the	manytenants	within	a	cloud	environment	and	that	a	single	system,	service,	or customer	does	not	consume	too	many	resources?  
A.	Share. 
B.	Reservation. 
C.	Limit. 
D.	Cap. 
Answer: C.	 

Limits	are	put	in	place	to	enforce	the	maximum	utilization	of memory	or	processing	by	a	cloud	customer.	These	limits	can	either	be done	at	the	virtual	machine	level	or	a	comprehensive	level	for	a customer.	They	are	meant	to	ensure	that	enormous	cloud	resources cannot	be	allocated	or	consumed	by	a	single	host	or	customer	to	the detriment	of	other	hosts	and	customers.	Along	with	cloud	computing features	such	as	auto-scaling	and	on-demand	self-service,	limits	can be	either	hard	(or	fixed)	or	flexible	and	allowed	to	change dynamically.	Typically,	when	limits	are	allowed	to	change dynamically	based	on	current	conditions	and	consumption,	it	is	done by	“borrowing”	additional	resources	rather	than	making	an	actual change	in	the	limits	themselves.
 	
A	is	incorrect	because	the	concept	of	shares	within	a	cloud environment	is	used	to	mitigate	and	control	customer	requests	for resource	allocations	in	case	the	environment	does	not	have	the	current capability	to	provide	these	resources.	Shares	work	by	prioritizing
hosts	within	a	cloud	environment	through	a	weighting	system	that	is defined	by	the	cloud	provider.	When	periods	of	high	utilization	and allocation	are	reached,	the	system	automatically	uses	the	scoring	of each	host	based	on	its	share	value	to	determine	which	hosts	get	access to	the	limited	resources	still	available.	The	higher	the	value	a particular	host	has,	the	more	resources	it	will	be	allowed	to	utilize.
 
B	is	incorrect	because	a	reservation	is	a	minimum	resource	level	that	is guaranteed	to	a	customer	within	a	cloud	environment.	A	reservation can	pertain	to	the	two	main	aspects	of	computing:	memory	and processing.	With	a	reservation	in	place,	a	cloud	customer	is guaranteed	by	the	cloud	provider	to	always	have	at	minimum	the necessary	resources	available	to	power	on	and	operate	any	of	its services.	In	large	cloud	environments	with	a	large	number	of customers,	this	feature	can	be	of	particular	importance	in	the	case	of denial	of	service	attacks	or	high	utilization	of	resources	by	other	hosts and	systems	because	it	offers	a	guaranteed	minimum	level	of operations	to	all	customers.
 	
D	is	incorrect	because	although	cap	sounds	similar	to	the	term	limits,	it is	not	a	correct	term	in	this	case.

### Question # 11 - One	of	the	most	crucial	metrics	for	a	BCDR	plan	is	how	long	it	takes	forservices	to	be	restored	to	a	point	of	satisfaction	for	management.	Which metric	represents	this	point	and	value?
A.	RTO
B.	RPO
C.	RSL
D.	SRE
 		A.	The	recovery	time	objective	(RTO)	is	a	measurement	of	the	amount of	time	it	would	take	to	recover	operations	in	the	event	of	a	disaster	to the	point	where	management’s	objectives	for	BCDR	are	met.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	the	recovery	point	objective	(RPO)	is	defined	as the	amount	of	data	a	company	would	need	to	maintain	and	recover	in order	to	function	at	a	level	acceptable	to	management.	This	may	or may	not	be	a	restoration	to	full	operating	capacity,	depending	on	what management	deems	as	crucial	and	essential.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	the	recovery	service	level	(RSL)	measures	the percentage	of	the	total	typical	production	service	level	that	needs	to	be restored	to	meet	BCDR	objectives	in	the	case	of	a	failure.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	SRE	is	provided	as	an	extraneous	choice	that	is not	pertinent	to	the	question.

### Question # 12 - When	resource	limitations	surpass	the	thresholds	determined	by	the	cloudprovider	and	shares	need	to	be	invoked,	which	of	the	following	is	the driving	factor	for	the	determination	of	share	allocations?
A.	Prioritization	weighting
B.	Size	of	customer
C.	Number	of	users
D.	Costs	of	resources
 		A.	Systems	and	services	within	a	cloud	environment	are	assigned	a prioritization	value	based	on	contractual	requirements,	level	of services	purchased,	or	other	possible	values.	When	limits	are	reached and	resources	need	to	be	allocated,	this	prioritization	weighting determines	the	order	in	which	systems	or	services	will	receive requested	resources.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	the	size	of	the	customer	is	not	pertinent	to	the prioritization	weighting	value,	as	it	is	dictated	by	the	customer’s contract	and/or	level	of	services	purchased.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	the	number	of	users	is	not	pertinent	to	the prioritization	weighting	value,	as	it	is	dictated	by	the	customer’s contract	and/or	level	of	services	purchased.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	the	cost	of	resources	is	not	pertinent	to	the prioritization	weighting	value,	as	it	is	dictated	by	the	customer’s contract	and/or	level	of	services	purchased.

### Question # 13 - Which	metric	is	used	to	determine	whether	BCDR	objectives	have	beenmet	and	measures	the	percentage	of	production-level	restoration	required for	success?
A.	RTO
B.	RPO
C.	RSL
D.	SRE
 	C.	The	recovery	service	level	(RSL)	measures	the	percentage	of	the total	typical	production	service	level	that	needs	to	be	restored	to	meet BCDR	objectives	in	the	case	of	a	failure.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	the	recovery	time	objective	(RTO)	is	a measurement	of	the	amount	of	time	it	would	take	to	recover operations	in	the	event	of	a	disaster	to	the	point	where	management’s objectives	for	BCDR	are	met.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	the	recovery	point	objective	(RPO)	is	defined	as the	amount	of	data	a	company	would	need	to	maintain	and	recover	in order	to	function	at	a	level	acceptable	to	management.	This	may	or may	not	be	a	restoration	to	full	operating	capacity,	depending	on	what management	deems	as	crucial	and	essential.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	SRE	is	provided	as	an	extraneous	choice	that	is not	pertinent	to	the	question.

### Question # 14 - Cloud	environments	are	based	entirely	on	virtual	machines	and	virtualdevices,	and	those	images	are	also	in	need	of	storage	within	the environment.	What	type	of	storage	is	typically	used	for	virtual	images?
A.	Volume
B.	Structured
C.	Unstructured
D.	Object
 		D.	Object	storage	is	hosted	external	from	systems	and	applications, and	is	accessed	via	a	key	value	for	each	object	it	stores.	It	is	not organized	in	a	directory	or	the	hierarchical	structure	of	a	file	system, but	rather	it	has	a	flat	structure	where	each	object	is	classified	with	an opaque	key	value.	Because	it	is	an	external	and	independent	system, and	not	tied	to	specific	customers,	services,	or	servers,	it	is	the	correct place	to	store	virtual	images.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	volume	storage	uses	the	same	traditional folders,	directories,	filenames,	and	structures	as	a	file	system	on	a regular	computer	or	server.	Although	it	could	use	filenames	that	look similar	to	key	values,	it	is	not	stored	or	accessed	in	the	same	manner as	object	storage.	It	is	tied	specifically	to	servers	that	are	provisioned for	customers	and	would	not	be	an	appropriate	storage	mechanism	for virtual	images.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	structured	storage	resembles	a	database paradigm,	with	defined	structures,	labels,	and	fields.	It	is	not	used	for general	object	types,	nor	does	it	use	key	values	in	the	same	sense	as object	storage.	It	is	allocated	to	specific	services	and	designed	to	meet their	needs,	and	would	not	be	an	appropriate	storage	location	for virtual	images.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	unstructured	storage	is	used	for	supporting	and auxiliary	files	in	conjunction	with	structured	storage,	but	it	does	not use	key	values	in	the	same	sense	as	object	storage	does.	It	is	allocated to	specific	services	and	designed	to	meet	their	needs,	and	would	not be	an	appropriate	storage	location	for	virtual	images.

### Question # 15 - 	An	organization	could	have	many	reasons	that	are	common	throughout the	industry	to	activate	a	BCDR	situation.	Which	of	the	following	is	NOT a	typical	reason	to	activate	a	BCDR	plan?
A.	Natural	disaster
B.	Utility	outage
C.	Staff	loss
D.	Terrorist	attack
 		C.	BCDR	situations	involve	widespread	problems	or	disasters	that typically	impact	an	entire	data	center	or	enterprise.	Loss	of	staff	would not	be	an	appropriate	time	to	utilize	a	BCDR	situation	because	it would	not	directly	affect	the	systems	and	hosting,	and	the	invocation of	a	BCDR	situation	is	highly	dependent	on	the	appropriate	staff	being available	and	accessible.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	a	natural	disaster	is	a	prime	consideration	of BCDR	strategies	and	would	be	a	widespread	event	that	could	impact an	entire	data	center.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	a	utility	outage	is	a	prime	consideration	of BCDR	strategies	and	would	be	a	widespread	event	that	could	impact an	entire	data	center.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	a	terrorist	attack	is	a	prime	consideration	of BCDR	strategies	and	would	be	a	widespread	event	that	could	impact an	entire	data	center.

### Question # 16 - What	type	of	system	is	exposed	to	the	public	Internet	but	to	maintainsecurity	is	designed	to	perform	just	a	specific	function	and	has	security controls	and	monitoring	in	place	specifically	focused	on	that	capability?
A.	Honeypot
B.	Bastion
C.	WAF
D.	VPN
 		B.	A	bastion	host	is	a	server	that	is	fully	exposed	to	the	public	Internet; it	is	extremely	hardened	to	prevent	attacks	and	is	usually	focused	for one	specific	application	or	usage	only.	This	singular	focus	allows	for much	more	stringent	security	hardening	and	monitoring.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	a	honeypot	is	designed	to	resemble	a	production system	with	production	data	in	order	to	entice	attackers	and	monitor the	methods	they	use	to	attempt	to	compromise	it.	This	knowledge	can then	be	used	to	augment	or	change	security	controls	to	meet	the	real threats	the	system	or	application	is	facing.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	a	web	application	firewall	(WAF)	is	designed	to filter	incoming	web	traffic	based	on	content	and	processes	and	then possibly	take	additional	security	measures	against	it,	reject	it,	filter	it, or	many	other	types	of	operations	that	can	be	offloaded	and	done	prior to	reaching	application	servers.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	a	virtual	private	network	(VPN)	is	designed	to provide	a	secure	network	tunnel	into	a	protected	network	from	the outside	and	enable	systems	administrative	staff	to	perform	their	work duties	or	to	access	sensitive	data	in	a	more	secure	manner.

### Question # 17 - Which	concept	provides	an	acceptable	level	of	assurance	that	anindividual	or	entity	is	in	fact	whom	they	claim	to	be?
A.	Identification
B.	Authentication
C.	Authorization
D.	Integrity
 		B.	Authentication	is	the	process	by	which	one	can	be	certain	that	the identification	presented	is	true.	By	policy,	this	is	done	to	an	extent	that a	system	can	properly	trust	the	access	request.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	identification	is	the	process	of	singling	out	an entity—either	a	person	or	system/application—in	a	manner	that	makes that	entity	unique	from	any	other	identity.	However,	it	does	not provide	a	mechanism	for	verifying	that	identity.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	authorization	grants	of	the	actual	roles	and entitlements	appropriate	for	the	user	or	system	process	to	gain	access
to	data	and	applications.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	integrity	pertains	to	the	security	concept	of ensuring	that	data	has	not	been	modified	by	an	unauthorized	party,	but it	is	not	related	to	this	specific	question.

### Question # 18 - A	federated	identity	system	is	composed	of	three	main	components.Which	of	the	following	is	NOT	one	of	the	three	main	components?
A.	Identity	provider
B.	User
C.	Relying	party
D.	API
 		D.	A	federated	identity	system	is	composed	of	users,	an	identity provider,	and	a	relying	party.	Although	API	calls	might	be	used	in conjunction	with	some	processes,	they	are	not	themselves	a	core component	of	a	federated	identity	system.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	an	identity	provider	is	a	key	component	of	a federated	identity	system.	It	performs	authentication	and	provides authentication	and	authorization	information	about	a	user	to	the relying	party.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	a	user	is	a	key	component	of	a	federated	identity system	as	the	one	requesting	access,	and	it	is	the	subject	of	the authentication	and	authorization	data	that	is	passed	between	the identity	provider	and	relying	party.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	the	relying	party	is	a	key	component	of	a federated	identity	system.	It	accepts	authentication	and	authorization information	on	a	user	for	the	identity	provider,	and	then	passes	this onto	the	application	for	appropriate	processing	and	access.

### Question # 19 - Measured	service	is	a	very	attractive	aspect	of	cloud	computing	for	anorganization	looking	for	BCDR	solutions	because	it	will	keep	costs	down. Which	of	the	following	is	also	a	key	aspect	of	cloud	computing	that	can make	BCDR	situations	easier	in	a	cloud	environment	than	in	a	traditional data	center?
A.	Broad	network	access
B.	Resource	pooling
C.	Multitenancy
D.	Reversibility
  A.	Broad	network	access	allows	cloud	services	to	be	accessed	from	the public	Internet	and	over	a	wide	assortment	of	clients	and	devices.	This is	especially	attractive	during	a	possible	BCDR	situation	because	it would	not	require	staff	to	travel	to	a	data	center	location	to	execute	the plan	and	would	allow	them	to	do	so	from	anywhere	they	can	get online.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	resource	pooling	(the	sharing	of	resources within	a	cloud	environment	among	all	the	cloud	customers)	would	not be	a	pertinent	factor	to	a	BCDR	solution,	nor	would	it	directly	impact the	solution.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	multitenancy	(the	hosting	of	many	different cloud	customers	within	the	same	cloud	environment)	would	not	be	a pertinent	factor	to	a	BCDR	solution,	nor	would	it	directly	impact	the solution.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	reversibility	(the	ability	to	completely	and quickly	remove	all	data	and	components	of	a	system	from	a	cloud environment)	would	be	an	important	factor	during	the	final	stages	of	a BCDR	situation,	but	it	is	not	the	best	answer	to	the	question	and	the key	points	it	addresses.

### Question # 20 - With	PaaS,	which	strategy	is	most	commonly	used	for	the	deployment	ofoperating	system	patches?
A.	Scripts
B.	Reimaging
C.	Customer	administration
D.	APIs
 		B.	With	PaaS,	the	most	common	method	for	deploying	operating system	matches	is	through	the	use	of	new	images	for	systems.	PaaS provides	a	full	application	framework	to	deploy	data	and	applications within,	and	it’s	maintained	by	the	cloud	provider.	With	a	locked configuration	that	is	centrally	maintained,	and	the	code	and	data	being housed	independent	of	the	underlying	system,	using	new	images	with patches	installed	and	tested	is	the	easier	and	most	efficient	way	for distribution.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	scripts	are	not	typically	used	for	operating system	patches	within	a	PaaS	deployment	model,	as	the	use	of	new and	tested	images	is	the	preferred	approach.
  C	is	incorrect	because	the	sole	responsibility	for	maintaining	the operating	system	within	a	PaaS	environment	lies	with	the	cloud provider,	and	in	most	instances	the	cloud	customer	would	not	even have	access	or	permissions	to	it.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	APIs	are	used	for	services	and	components	to communicate	with	each	other	and	to	exchange	data.	They	would	not be	used	(or	appropriate	to	use)	for	operating	system	patches	regardless of	the	cloud	deployment	model.

### Question # 21 - 	During	a	system	or	application	audit,	which	of	the	following	populationswill	be	the	most	important	driver	of	the	audit	and	testing?
A.	Regulators
B.	Management
C.	Shareholders
D.	Users
 		A.	During	almost	all	audit	and	testing	processes,	the	main	driver	will be	the	regulators	and	the	regulations	to	which	the	data	is	subjected. Regulations	will	drive	most	audits	to	ensure	compliance,	and	they form	the	starting	point	for	company	security	policies	and requirements.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	although	management	desires	and	demands	will have	a	strong	representation	in	audits	and	testing,	the	main	focus	will be	on	regulators	and	the	regulations	they	are	responsible	for	enforcing.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	although	shareholders’	desires	and	demands	will have	a	strong	representation	in	audits	and	testing,	the	main	focus	will be	on	regulators	and	the	regulations	they	are	responsible	for	enforcing.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	users	will	not	form	a	major	audience	for	the testing	and	auditing	of	systems,	apart	from	the	focus	of	protecting their	data	and	privacy	via	regulation.

### Question # 22 - A	primary	focus	during	a	BCDR	situation	is	for	systems	and	applicationsto	meet	an	acceptable	level	of	operations.	Which	value	represents	this status? A.		RTO
B.	RPO
C.	RSL
D.	SRE
  B.	The	recovery	point	objective	(RPO)	is	defined	as	the	amount	of data	a	company	would	need	to	maintain	and	recover	in	order	to function	at	a	level	acceptable	to	management.	This	may	or	may	not	be a	restoration	to	full	operating	capacity,	depending	on	what management	deems	as	crucial	and	essential.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	the	recovery	time	objective	(RTO)	is	a measurement	of	the	amount	of	time	it	would	take	to	recover operations	in	the	event	of	a	disaster	to	the	point	where	management’s objectives	for	BCDR	are	met.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	the	recovery	service	level	(RSL)	measures	the percentage	of	the	total	typical	production	service	level	that	needs	to	be restored	to	meet	BCDR	objectives	in	the	case	of	a	failure.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	SRE	is	provided	as	an	extraneous	choice	that	is not	pertinent	to	the	question.

### Question # 23 - 	A	variety	of	limits	can	be	set	within	a	cloud	environment.	Which	of	thefollowing	is	NOT	a	unit	where	a	limit	can	be	set?
A.	Customer
B.	Application
C.	Virtual	machine
D.	Hypervisor
 		D.	Limits	can	be	placed	within	a	cloud	environment	on	the	granular level	of	customers,	applications,	or	virtual	machines.	However,	they cannot	be	placed	on	the	level	of	the	hypervisor.	In	a	cloud environment,	resources	and	virtual	machines	will	be	constantly moving	around	due	to	orchestration,	so	at	any	time	it	is	impossible	to predict	what	hypervisors	resources	may	be	on,	or	how	long	they	will be	utilizing	a	particular	piece	of	hardware.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	limits	can	be	and	commonly	are	set	at	the	level of	a	particular	customer.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	limits	can	be	and	commonly	are	set	at	the	level of	a	particular	application.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	limits	can	be	and	commonly	are	set	at	the	level of	a	particular	virtual	machine.

### Question # 24 - Which	of	the	following	capabilities	would	NOT	be	covered	by	a reservation	within	a	cloud	environment?
A.	Running	applications
B.	Starting	virtual	machines
C.	Auto-scaling
D.	Performing	normal	business	operations
 		C.	With	reservations,	a	cloud	customer	is	guaranteed	a	minimal amount	of	resources	to	power	on	its	virtual	devices	and	perform	a level	of	business	operations.	Auto-scaling	involves	the	changing	of allocated	resources,	usually	by	increasing	them	during	high	load,	and as	such	would	not	be	covered	under	a	reservation.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	running	applications	that	are	deployed	in	a cloud	environment	is	a	core	component	of	reservations	and	the	level granted	to	a	particular	cloud	customer,	system,	or	application.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	starting	virtual	machines	that	are	already established	in	a	cloud	environment	is	a	core	component	of reservations	and	the	level	granted	to	a	particular	cloud	customer, system,	or	application.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	performing	normal	business	operations	in	a cloud	environment	is	a	core	component	of	reservations	and	the	level granted	to	a	particular	cloud	customer,	system,	or	application.

### Question # 25 - Without	the	ability	to	segregate	networks	physically	within	a	cloudenvironment,	what	concept	is	heavily	used	for	network	isolation	and segmentation?
A.	WAN
B.	VLAN
C.	LAN
D.	Firewalls
 		B.	VLANs	allow	dedicated	IP	address	spacing	for	servers	that	are	in the	same	class	or	belong	to	the	same	application	or	customer,	giving enhanced	security	to	and	isolation	from	other	systems	at	the	network level.	VLANs	are	not	dependent	on	physical	network	devices	and	as such	can	span	across	data	centers	regardless	of	where	hardware	is physically	located;	servers	do	not	need	to	be	in	the	same	racks	or	even connected	to	the	same	switches	or	routers.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	a	wide	area	network	(WAN)	is	a	network	that extends	over	a	broad	geographic	area,	but	is	not	related	to	network isolation	and	segmentation.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	a	local	area	network	(LAN)	is	used	for connecting	computers	within	a	building	or	localized	area,	but	is	not related	to	network	segmentation	or	isolation.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	firewalls	are	used	to	deny	or	allow	network traffic	based	on	origination	or	destination	IP	address,	protocol,	and port,	but	are	not	used	themselves	for	network	isolation	and segmentation.

### Question # 26 - 	Under	the	guidance	of	industry-accepted	best	practices,	which	of	thefollowing	is	the	correct	frequency	for	BCDR	plan	testing?
A.	Annually
B.	Monthly
C.	Quarterly
D.	Bi-annually
 		A.	Industry-accepted	best	practices,	as	well	as	many	certification requirements,	specify	annual	testing	of	BCDR	plans.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	industry-accepted	best	practices,	as	well	as many	certification	requirements,	specify	annual	testing	of	BCDR plans.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	industry-accepted	best	practices,	as	well	as many	certification	requirements,	specify	annual	testing	of	BCDR plans.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	industry-accepted	best	practices,	as	well	as many	certification	requirements,	specify	annual	testing	of	BCDR plans.

### Question # 27 - Software-defined	networking	(SDN)	is	intended	to	separate	differentnetwork	capabilities	and	allow	for	the	granting	of	granular	configurations, permissions,	and	features	to	non-network	staff	or	customers.	Which network	capability	is	separated	from	forwarding	of	traffic?
A.	Routing
B.	Firewalling
C.	Filtering
D.	IPS
 		C.	SDN	separates	out	the	filtering	of	network	traffic	from	the	actual
packet	routing,	allowing	for	a	granular	level	of	permissions	and	the ability	to	allow	non-network	admins	to	update	some	configurations without	giving	them	actual	access	to	network	hardware	or	full	access.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	routing	is	the	same	as	forwarding,	and	in	this instance	is	not	something	delegated	to	non-network	personnel.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	firewalls	are	separate	devices	that	perform specific	security	functions	in	regard	to	network	traffic,	but	are	not	part of	SDN.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	an	intrusion	prevention	system	(IPS)	is	a separate	device	that	allows	for	the	filtering	and	blocking	of	specific traffic	and	content.

### Question # 28 - 	Different	storage	paradigms	within	a	cloud	environment	handleformatting,	allocation,	and	security	controls	differently.	What	handles these	aspects	for	volume	storage?
A.	Operating	system	of	host
B.	Hypervisor
C.	Management	plane
D.	Storage	host
 		A.	Volume	storage	is	allocated	to	a	specific	host	and	then	mounted	the same	as	a	physical	drive	would	be	on	a	traditional	server.	At	that point,	the	operating	system	is	responsible	for	the	formatting, provisioning,	and	security	controls	of	the	storage,	the	same	as	with	a physical	server.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	the	operating	system	of	the	host	is	responsible for	the	formatting,	allocation,	and	security	control	of	volume	storage.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	the	operating	system	of	the	host	is	responsible for	the	formatting,	allocation,	and	security	control	of	volume	storage.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	the	operating	system	of	the	host	is	responsible for	the	formatting,	allocation,	and	security	control	of	volume	storage.

### Question # 29 - Which	aspect	of	cloud	computing	would	be	most	negatively	impacted	byincurring	vendor	lock-in	with	a	cloud	provider?
A.	Interoperability
B.	Reversibility
C.	Portability
D.	Scalability
 		C.	Portability	is	the	ability	for	services	and	applications	to	easily	move between	different	cloud	providers.	The	more	a	customer	relies	on proprietary	APIs	or	offerings	of	a	specific	cloud	provider,	the	harder	it will	be	later	to	move	to	a	different	cloud	provider,	thus	causing	the customer	to	incur	vendor	lock-in.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	interoperability	is	the	ability	to	reuse	functions and	components	from	applications	for	other	purposes.	Although	it could	be	impacted	by	vendor	lock-in	through	the	reliance	on proprietary	APIs,	portability	is	the	better	answer.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	reversibility	is	the	ability	to	quickly	and	easily remove	all	systems,	services,	and	data	from	a	cloud	provider,	and	to ensure	that	these	items	have	been	removed	in	a	timely	manner.	The reliance	on	proprietary	APIs	or	other	offerings	would	not	have	a significant	impact	on	reversibility.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	scalability	is	the	ability	to	add	or	remove resources	from	a	system	or	service,	usually	automatically	and programmatically,	to	meet	current	demand.	Although	this	could	be impacted	when	moving	to	a	new	cloud	environment	that	might	work differently,	the	real	problem	is	with	portability,	which	in	this	case	is the	better	answer.

### Question # 30 - A	denial	of	service	(DoS)	attack	can	potentially	impact	all	customerswithin	a	cloud	environment	with	the	continued	allocation	of	additional resources.	Which	of	the	following	can	be	useful	for	a	customer	to	protect themselves	from	a	DoS	attack	against	another	customer?
A.	Limits
B.	Reservations
C.	Shares
D.	Borrows
 		B.	A	reservation	is	a	minimum	resource	level	guaranteed	to	a	customer within	a	cloud	environment.	A	reservation	can	pertain	to	the	two	main aspects	of	computing:	memory	and	processing.	With	a	reservation	in place,	a	cloud	customer	is	guaranteed	by	the	cloud	provider	to	always have	at	minimum	the	necessary	resources	available	to	power	on	and operate	any	of	its	services.	In	large	cloud	environments	with	a	large number	of	customers,	this	feature	can	be	of	particular	importance	in
the	case	of	denial	of	service	attacks	or	high	utilization	of	resources	by other	hosts	and	systems	because	it	offers	a	guaranteed	minimum	level of	operations	to	all	customers.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	limits	are	put	in	place	to	enforce	maximum utilization	of	memory	or	processing	by	a	cloud	customer.	These	limits can	either	be	done	at	the	virtual	machine	level	or	a	comprehensive level	for	a	customer.	They	are	meant	to	ensure	that	enormous	cloud resources	cannot	be	allocated	or	consumed	by	a	single	host	or customer	to	the	detriment	of	other	hosts	and	customers.	Along	with cloud	computing	features	such	as	auto-scaling	and	on-demand	selfservice,	limits	can	be	either	hard	(or	fixed)	or	flexible	and	allowed	to change	dynamically.	Typically,	when	limits	are	allowed	to	change dynamically	based	on	current	conditions	and	consumption,	it	is	done by	“borrowing”	additional	resources	rather	than	through	a	change	in the	actual	limits	themselves.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	the	concept	of	shares	within	a	cloud environment	is	used	to	mitigate	and	control	customer	requests	for resource	allocations	in	case	the	environment	does	not	have	the	current capability	to	provide	these	resources.	Shares	work	by	prioritizing hosts	within	a	cloud	environment	through	a	weighting	system	that	is defined	by	the	cloud	provider.	When	periods	of	high	utilization	and allocation	are	reached,	the	system	automatically	uses	the	scoring	of each	host	based	on	its	share	value	to	determine	which	hosts	get	access to	the	limited	resources	still	available.	The	higher	the	value	a particular	host	has,	the	more	resources	it	will	be	allowed	to	utilize.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	borrows	is	a	similar	sounding	term	to	shares, but	it	is	not	a	correct	term	and	isn’t	pertinent	to	the	question.

### Question # 31 - What	aspect	of	a	Type	2	hypervisor	involves	additional	security	concernsthat	are	not	relevant	with	a	Type	1	hypervisor?
A.	Reliance	on	a	host	operating	system
B.	Proprietary	software
C.	Programming	languages
D.	Auditing
 		A.	A	Type	2	hypervisor	runs	within	a	host	operating	system	(versus	a Type	1	hypervisor,	which	runs	directly	on	the	underlying	physical hardware).	Because	of	this,	a	Type	2	hypervisor	has	additional
security	concerns	because	the	underlying	operating	system	and	its security	become	crucial	to	the	hypervisor	as	well.	If	the	underlying operating	system	is	compromised,	so	too	can	the	hosted	hypervisor	be easily	compromised.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	proprietary	software	is	not	a	unique consideration	to	either	a	Type	1	or	Type	2	hypervisor,	and	as	such	the security	concerns	would	be	the	same.
 	C	is	incorrect	as	programming	languages	used	within	hosted applications	do	not	have	any	bearing	on	the	hypervisor.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	auditing	itself	is	not	a	security	concern,	and compliance	requirements	would	apply	to	both	types	of	hypervisors.

### Question # 32 - 	A	common	strategy	employed	when	using	cloud	services	for	BCDR strategies	is	to	only	maintain	images	offline	at	the	cloud	provider,	or	to only	have	a	minimal	set	of	systems	running	until	needed.	With	the strategy	of	only	running	a	minimal	level	of	systems	until	needed,	which aspect	of	cloud	computing	would	be	most	beneficial	during	an	actual BCDR	situation?
A.	Resource	pooling
B.	Measured	service
C.	Rapid	elasticity
D.	Broad	network	access
 		C.	When	only	a	minimal	level	of	resources	is	being	run	within	a	cloud environment,	rapid	elasticity	could	be	very	important	as	systems	and traffic	are	brought	online	during	a	BCDR	situation	so	that	systems	can automatically	grow	and	adjust	as	needed.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	resource	pooling	would	not	have	a	direct	or significant	impact	on	BCDR	solutions,	nor	would	it	pertain	to	the strategy	of	having	only	limited	resources	online	until	needed.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	measured	service	allows	costs	to	remain	low while	only	a	minimal	level	of	services	are	maintained.	Once	an organization	is	in	an	actual	BCDR	situation	and	its	resource	needs begin	increasing,	measured	service	becomes	less	of	a	benefit.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	although	broad	network	access	would	be	a benefit	for	BCDR,	as	it	would	allow	administrative	staff	to	access systems	from	anywhere,	it	does	not	pertain	specifically	to	the	question in	regard	to	maintaining	a	minimal	level	of	services	until	needed.

### Question # 33 - With	volume	storage,	a	slice	of	storage	space	is	allocated	to	a	system	tobe	used	in	whatever	manner	is	necessary	for	that	particular	system	and	its requirements.	What	is	this	slice	of	storage	referred	to	as?
A.	LAN
B.	LUN
C.	Partition
D.	Allocation
 		B.	A	LUN	is	a	logical	unit	number	that	is	assigned	to	storage	in	a	SAN environment	to	be	accessed	by	controller	hardware	or	software.	It represents	how	storage	is	mapped	and	allocated	to	a	particular	system.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	a	local	area	network	(LAN)	does	not	pertain	to storage	systems	at	all.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	a	partition	is	related	to	storage	and	its	allocation but	is	not	pertinent	to	the	question.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	although	allocation	refers	to	the	process	of storage	being	given	to	a	particular	host,	it	is	not	the	best	answer	to	the question.

### Question # 34 - 	Although	cloud	storage	systems	will	ultimately	be	consumed	by	cloud customers	or	users	from	a	logical	configuration,	what	are	the	two	types	of underlying	physical	storage	systems	most	used	with	cloud	computing?
A.	RAID	and	SAN
B.	SAN	and	iSCSI
C.	SCSI	and	RAID
D.	iSCSI	and	RAID
 		A.	Redundant	array	of	independent	disks	(RAID)	and	storage	area network	(SAN)	are	the	two	main	underlying	types	of	physical	storage systems	used	with	cloud	systems,	and	then	shared	and	provisioned with	the	hypervisors,	which	then	assign	these	physical	storage	systems to	their	hosted	systems.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	iSCSI	is	a	communications	protocol	that	allows SCSI	commands	to	be	sent	over	TCP,	but	it	is	not	a	storage	system itself.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	SCSI	is	a	communications	protocol	used	with physical	hardware	for	controlling	and	accessing	the	storage.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	iSCSI	is	a	communications	protocol	that	allows SCSI	commands	to	be	sent	over	TCP,	but	it	is	not	a	storage	system itself.

### Question # 35 - 	Although	performing	BCDR	tests	at	regular	intervals	is	a	best	practice	toensure	processes	and	documentation	are	still	relevant	and	efficient,	which of	the	following	represents	a	reason	to	conduct	a	BCDR	review	outside	of the	regular	interval? A.		Staff	changes
B.	Application	changes
C.	Regulatory	changes
D.	Management	changes
 		B.	Any	major	application	changes	have	the	ability	to	fundamentally alter	systems	and	configurations	in	a	manner	that	will	render	a	BCDR plan	irrelevant	or	insufficient.	Therefore,	any	time	major	application changes	are	made,	a	new	BCDR	test	should	be	undertaken	after	a review	to	certify	that	it	is	still	applicable	and	correct.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	staffing	changes	will	not	directly	impact systems	or	their	configurations,	and	as	such	new	testing	or	validation of	a	BCDR	plan	is	unnecessary.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	regulatory	changes	may	lead	to	system	or application	changes,	so	they	would	only	have	an	indirect	impact	on	a BCDR	plan.	If	major	system	changes	are	necessary,	then	the	best answer	applies	to	those	changes,	not	the	underlying	regulatory changes.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	management	changes	will	not	directly	impact systems	or	their	configurations,	and	as	such	new	testing	or	validation of	a	BCDR	plan	is	unnecessary.

### Question # 36 - When	an	organization	is	considering	the	use	of	a	cloud	provider	as	part	of its	BCDR	strategy,	which	of	the	following	is	most	important	to	consider from	a	security	perspective?
A.	Auditing
B.	Network	access
C.	Jurisdiction
D.	Resource	pooling
 		C.	When	an	organization	is	choosing	a	cloud	provider	for	a	BCDR solution,	jurisdiction	becomes	an	important	security	consideration because	it	is	almost	certain	the	BCDR	site	will	fall	outside	the jurisdiction	of	the	main	data-hosting	facility.	As	such,	it	is	imperative to	ensure	that	any	cloud	solution	is	made	with	an	understanding	of jurisdictional	and	regulatory	impacts	to	applications.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	auditing	will	remain	the	same,	with	the	same requirements,	regardless	of	the	BCDR	location.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	network	access	is	not	a	major	security	concern with	a	different	cloud	provider,	as	all	cloud	providers	will	utilize broad	network	access.	Although	there	may	be	some	impact	to	the access	methods	or	procedures,	network	access	is	not	the	best	answer to	the	question.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	resource	pooling	will	not	have	an	impact	on	an organization’s	BCDR	strategy	from	a	security	perspective.

### Question # 37 - Why	does	the	use	of	a	Type	2	hypervisor	typically	incur	more	securityconcerns	than	a	Type	1	hypervisor?
A.	A	Type	2	hypervisor	is	always	exposed	to	the	public	Internet	forfederated	identity	access.
B.	A	Type	2	hypervisor	allows	users	to	directly	perform	some	functionswith	their	own	access.
C.	A	Type	2	hypervisor	runs	on	top	of	an	operating	system	and	isdependent	on	the	security	of	that	OS	for	its	own	security.
D.	A	Type	2	hypervisor	is	open	source,	so	attackers	can	more	easily	findexploitable	vulnerabilities.
 		C.	A	Type	2	hypervisor	runs	on	top	of	an	operating	system,	unlike	a Type	1	hypervisor,	which	runs	directly	on	hardware.	This	makes	the Type	2	hypervisor	dependent	on	the	operating	system	for	its	security.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	hypervisors	are	never	directly	exposed	to	the public	Internet,	regardless	of	the	type	used.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	users	do	not	directly	interact	with	hypervisors, regardless	of	the	type	used.
 	D	is	incorrect	because	whether	or	not	a	hypervisor	is	open	source	is not	related	to	the	type	of	hypervisor	used.

### Question # 38 - 	When	is	a	system	hosted	in	a	virtualized	environment	vulnerable	but	NOT vulnerable	on	a	physical	server?
A.	During	patching
B.	During	maintenance
C.	During	change	windows
D.	When	the	image	is	offline
 		D.	When	a	physical	server	is	powered	off,	it	is	not	accessible	to attackers.	However,	with	a	virtualized	environment,	even	when	it	is powered	off,	the	virtual	image	resides	in	storage,	and	if	the	storage system	is	compromised,	the	virtual	image	is	vulnerable	as	well.
 	A	is	incorrect	because	patching	does	not	have	a	significant	difference in	vulnerability	between	a	virtual	environment	and	a	physical environment.
 	B	is	incorrect	because	maintenance	patching	does	not	have	a significant	difference	in	vulnerability	between	a	virtual	environment and	a	physical	environment.
 	C	is	incorrect	because	change	windows	do	not	have	a	significant difference	in	vulnerability	between	a	virtual	environment	and	a physical	environment.
