# SAML

## What is SAML?
- **SAML** (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an **open** standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers (IdPs) and
  service providers (SPs). It‚Äôs XML-based and widely used in Single Sign-On (SSO) systems.

## What is an Assertion?
- An assertion is a **package of information** that the **IdP sends to the SP**. It tells the SP:
	‚úÖ Who the user is (Authentication)
	‚úÖ What the user can do (Authorization)
	‚úÖ Other attributes about the user (Attributes)
- So, an identity assertion token is essentially the **SAML message** **carrying user‚Äôs identity and claims**.

## Types of SAML Assertions
- **SAML** defines **three** types of assertions (tokens):
1. Authentication Assertion
	- Proves the user‚Äôs identity (e.g., Ravi successfully logged in at 10:00AM using password).
2. Attribute Assertion
	- Provides additional details (e.g., Ravi‚Äôs role = Admin, Department = Security).
3. Authorization Decision Assertion
	- Specifies access rights (e.g., Ravi is permitted to access financial records).

## SAML Identity Assertion Token Flow (SSO Example)
1. User tries to access a cloud service (SP).
2. SP redirects to IdP.
3. IdP authenticates the user.
4. **IdP creates a SAML assertion token ‚Üí digitally signed XML**.
5. Token is sent back to SP.
6. SP validates the token ‚Üí grants access.

## Why It Matters?
- Enables SSO across multiple services without multiple logins.
- Provides secure, signed proof of identity.
- Avoids storing passwords in multiple places.

üëâ In short: A SAML identity assertion token is the **signed XML message issued by the Identity Provider**, which carries the authenticated identity (and possibly roles/permissions) of a user to the Service Provider for secure access.


# SAML identity assertions vs. OAuth access tokens vs. OpenID Connect ID tokens

## Quick Way to Remember:
- SAML ‚Üí Old school, XML-based, enterprise SSO.
- OAuth ‚Üí Delegated authorization (what you can do).
- OIDC ‚Üí Authentication built on OAuth (who you are).

## ‚ö°Example in real life:
- SAML ‚Üí Employee logs in once to use multiple internal apps (HR portal, payroll, CRM).
- OAuth ‚Üí Mobile app wants access to your Google Drive files (without knowing your password).
- OIDC ‚Üí Website uses Google/Facebook login button to know who you are.
