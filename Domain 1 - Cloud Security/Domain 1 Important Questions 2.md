### Comprehensive	Answers	and	Explanations

### Question # 1 - Which	concept	of	cloud	computing	pertains	to	the	ability	for	a	cloud customer	and	users	to	access	their	services	through	a	variety	of	different devices	and	locations?    
A.	Interoperability    
B.	Open	source    
C.	Broad	network	access    
D.	Single	sign-on 

Answer: C.	   

Broad	network	access	pertains	to	the	availability	of	cloud	resources from	virtually	any	network	location,	and	through	any	type	of	device. This	can	be	from	corporate	networks	or	from	the	public	Internet	on virtually	any	type	of	connection.	In	regard	to	devices,	while	many cloud	services	are	accessed	via	web	browsers	and	mobile	applications, it	is	possible	to	use	any	type	of	thick	or	thin	desktop	client	that	is appropriate	as	well.

A	is	incorrect	because	interoperability	refers	to	the	ease	with	which one	can	move	or	reuse	components	of	an	application	or	service.	For systems	and	applications	with	a	high	level	of	interoperability,	the customer	is	not	bound	or	locked	in	to	a	particular	cloud	provider,	and has	the	option	to	move	between	them.	This	allows	far	great	flexibility for	a	cloud	customer,	and	the	ability	to	continually	shop	for	the	best financial	and	feature	options	from	different	cloud	providers.

B	is	incorrect	because	“open	source”	refers	to	a	style	and	methodology of	software	development	and	distribution,	not	the	manner	in	which	the applications	themselves	are	accessed	once	deployed.	With	open source	software,	the	full	source	code	is	available	for	distribution	to anyone	who	wants	it,	even	if	binary	distributions	are	offered	as	well. This	allows	for	understanding	or	auditing	of	the	source	code,	as	well as	for	those	interested	to	contribute	to	the	software	development.	It also	offers	the	opportunity	for	someone	to	modify	the	source	code	for their	particular	needs.	Many	commonly	used	applications	are	open
source,	such	as	Apache,	Perl,	PHP,	MySQL,	and	even	the	Linux operating	system.

D	is	incorrect	because,	although	single	sign-on	is	very	often	a component	of	cloud-based	applications,	it	is	not	a	requirement,	nor does	it	refer	specifically	to	the	manner	in	which	applications	or services	are	accessed.	Single	sign-on	systems	offer	the	ability	for users	to	sign	into	one	source	and	then,	through	cookies,	tokens,	or some	other	method	of	maintaining	state,	pass	from	one	application	to another	without	having	to	authenticate	again	for	each	one.

### Question # 2 - Your	new	contract	with	a	customer	requires	the	certification	of cryptographic	modules	used	within	your	systems	and	applications.	Which certification	framework	would	be	the	MOST	appropriate	to	utilize	to comply	with	the	contractual	requirements?    
A.	FIPS	140-2    
B.	NIST	SP	800-53    
C.	SOC	2   
D.	ISO/IEC	27001           

Answer: A.	    

The	Federal	Information	Processing	Standard	(FIPS)	140-2 publication,	authored	by	the	National	Institutes	of	Standards	and Technology	(NIST)	of	the	United	States,	is	a	process	by	which cryptographic	modules	are	evaluated	and	certified.	It	applies	to	both the	hardware	and	software	components	used	during	cryptographic processes,	and	it’s	based	on	the	particular	needs	for	confidentiality	and integrity	of	the	data	being	protected.	It	is	composed	of	four	levels, with	increasing	intensities	of	security	controls	and	implementations	of them.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	NIST	SP	800-53	is	a	publication	and	set	of guidelines	that	governs	security	controls	for	all	IT	systems	of	the	US federal	government,	except	those	pertaining	to	national	security systems.	It	is	designed	and	intended	to	serve	as	an	aid	for	federal agencies	in	the	governance	of	the	IT	systems	and	data,	specifically	in regard	to	the	implementation	of	federal	laws	and	policies	related	to them.

C	is	incorrect	because	Service	Organization	Controls	(SOC)	Type	2 reports	serve	as	more	general	framework	evaluations	of	the	security controls	and	postures	of	an	organization,	and	not	specifically	focused
on	the	evaluation	or	certification	of	cryptographic	modules.	SOC	2 reports	focus	on	a	core	collection	of	trust	principles,	including security,	processing	integrity,	availability,	privacy,	and	confidentiality.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	ISO/IEC	27001	is	considered	a	broad	and general	“gold	standard”	for	security	certification	and	guidance.	It comprehensively	covers	all	areas	of	security	controls	and	policies,	and is	not	specifically	focused	on	cryptographic	modules	or	their certification.

### Question # 3 - Which	of	the	following	aspects	of	an	application	is	MOST	likely	to	be	a component	of	measured	service	with	all	SaaS	implementations?                    
A.	CPU    
B.	Storage    
C.	Number	of	users     
D.	Memory   

Answer: C.	      

Within	a	Software	as	a	Service	(SaaS)	implementation,	cloud customers	are	acquiring	and	paying	for	services	that	are	explicitly	tied to	the	use	of	a	fully	operational	application	package	that	is	completely designed,	maintained,	and	implemented	by	the	cloud	provider.	Billing is	often	measured	based	on	the	number	of	users	or	the	number	of transactions	the	organization	does	with	the	application,	rather	than traditional	computing	resources	associated	with	other	service categories.

A	is	incorrect	because	CPU	resources	are	the	responsibility	of	the cloud	provider	within	a	SaaS	implementation,	to	ensure	they	are sufficiently	allocated	to	support	and	meet	the	requirements	of	the customers.s

B	is	incorrect	for	the	same	reasons	as	CPU.	However,	in	some circumstances,	depending	on	the	actual	software	application	and	the needs	of	the	customer,	there	could	be	incremental	storage	costs,	but these	are	handled	on	a	case-by-case	basis	and	are	not	necessarily something	that	is	universal	across	SaaS	implementations.	The	main exception	to	this	would	be	for	public	SaaS	implementations	such	as iCloud,	Dropbox,	and	OneDrive,	where	the	services	at	a	base	level	are free,	with	incremental	charges	for	additional	storage	capacity.

D	is	incorrect	because	memory	and	CPU,	in	this	sense,	would	be similar	in	that	it	is	incumbent	on	the	cloud	provider	to	ensure appropriate	computing	resources	are	allocated	and	available	to	the applications	and	users.

### Question # 4 - In	a	traditional	data	center,	resources	are	owned,	controlled,	and maintained	by	a	single	entity	for	their	exclusive	use	for	services	and systems.	Within	a	cloud	environment,	this	infrastructure	is	shared	among many	different	customers.	What	is	this	concept	called?    
A.	Co-location   
B.	Elasticity    
C.	System	sharing   
D.	Resource	pooling    

Answer: D.	

Resource	pooling	is	largely	what	separates	a	traditional	data	center from	a	cloud	in	regard	to	computing	resources.	In	a	traditional	data center,	resources	are	allocated	to	specific	systems	or	applications,	and for	the	most	part	are	not	shared.	Within	a	cloud,	the	entire	hardware infrastructure	is	viewed	as	an	aggregate	and	then	allocated accordingly	to	the	various	cloud	customers	and	applications	hosted within	it.	This	is	typically	a	massive	pool	of	resources	that	not	only can	handle	the	typical	operational	load	of	the	hosted	applications,	but also	allow	for	expansion	through	auto-elasticity	or	cyclical	loads	of some	applications.

A	is	incorrect	because	co-location	refers	to	the	hosting	of	multiple applications	or	systems	within	the	same	physical	hardware,	but	not necessarily	through	the	use	of	pooled	and	allocated	resources.	This can	also	be	done	within	a	traditional	data	center,	where	any	level	of hardware	can	be	shared,	including	networking,	physical	floor	space, cooling,	and	power.	The	typically	dedicated	nature	of	resources	within a	co-location	setup	is	what	differentiates	it	from	resource	pooling within	a	cloud	environment.

B	is	incorrect	because	elasticity	refers	to	the	ability	for	systems, services,	and	applications	to	automatically	expand	or	shrink	to	meet actual	needs	at	the	time.	If	the	applications	are	written	to	support elasticity,	then	as	load	changes	are	detected	in	the	environment	and meet	predefined	thresholds,	the	cloud	environment	can	dynamically and	rapidly	resize	the	resources	allocated	to	meet	exactly	what	is needed,	rather	than	having	enormous	resources	on	standby	to	handle any	sudden	increase	in	demand.

C	is	incorrect	because	system	sharing	is	provided	as	an	erroneous answer.	Although	it	is	a	similar	type	of	answer	to	resource	pooling,	it is	not	a	typically	used	or	official	term	for	anything	related	to	cloud computing,	or	this	specific	question.

### Question # 5 - Which	of	the	following	concepts,	pertaining	to	cloud	computing,	[allows the	cloud	customer	to	provision	services	with	minimal	assistance	or involvement]	from	the	cloud	provider?      
A.	On-demand	self-service    
B.	Auto-scaling    
C.	Elasticity    
D.	Customer	self-provisioning    

Answer: A.	

Cloud	services	can	be	requested,	provisioned,	and	put	into	use	by the	customer	through	automated	means,	without	the	need	to	interact with	support	personnel	of	the	cloud	provider.	This	is	typically	offered to	the	cloud	customer	through	a	web	portal,	but	can	also	be	exposed through	API	calls	or	other	programmatic	means.	As	services	are changed,	billing	is	adjusted	based	on	the	changing	nature	of	the currently	allocated	resources.

B	is	incorrect	because	auto-scaling	refers	to	the	automatic	and programmatic	ability	for	a	cloud	environment	to	dynamically	adjust	to current	demands.	Although	this	is	similar	in	some	ways	to	on-demand self-service,	the	difference	is	with	the	automatic	nature	of	the processes.	On-demand	self-service	is	something	originated	and requested	by	the	cloud	customer	at	the	time,	rather	than	something that	is	programmed	with	thresholds	and	rulesets	to	execute automatically.

C	is	incorrect	because	elasticity	refers	to	the	ability	of	a	cloud	or application	environment	to	change	resources	as	demand	changes.	An application	or	service	must	be	designed	in	such	a	way	to	allow	for easy	expansion	of	resources,	and	implemented	in	such	a	way	that programmatic	means	can	be	used	to	do	so.

D	is	incorrect	because	customer	self-provisioning	is	an	erroneous answer	that	is	similar	to	the	actual	answer	of	on-demand	self-service. Although	the	terms	sound	very	similar,	it	is	not	the	official	or commonly	used	term	for	such	capabilities.

### [important] Question # 6 - Which	concept	of	cloud	computing	[pertains	to	the	ability	to	reuse] components	and	services	[of	an	application	for	other	purposes]?    
A.	Portability    
B.	Interoperability    
C.	Resource	pooling    
D.	Elasticity    

Answer: B.	

Interoperability	is	the	ease	with	which	one	can	move	or	reuse components	of	an	application	or	service.	
The	main	concept	is	to	not have	such	dependencies	on	the	underlying	operating	system,	hosting environment,	libraries,	or	APIs	that	lock	in	a	service	to	one	particular set	of	hosts	or	solutions.	Services	with	a	high	degree	of interoperability	can	easily	move	between	cloud	providers,	hosting configurations,	and	cloud	service	categories,	and	give	enormous flexibility	to	an	organization.	
This	allows	different	services	to leverage	applications	and	APIs	for	different	purposes,	along	with	the modularization	of	components	for	reuse.

A	is	incorrect	because	portability,	while	similar	to	interoperability, focuses	solely	on	the	ability	to	move	between	cloud	providers,	and	not on	the	ability	to	use	components	or	modules	from	a	particular	service for	other	or	extended	purposes.	For	portability,	the	main	focus	is	not on	reuse	or	repurposing,	but	rather	solely	on	the	ability	to	freely	and easily	move.

C	is	incorrect	because	resource	pooling	refers	to	the	sharing	of resources	within	the	cloud	environment,	where	the	entire	hardware infrastructure	is	viewed	as	an	aggregate	and	then	allocated accordingly	to	the	various	cloud	customers	and	applications	hosted within	it.	This	is	typically	a	massive	pool	of	resources	that	not	only can	handle	the	typical	operational	load	of	the	hosted	applications,	but also	allow	for	expansion	through	auto-elasticity	or	cyclical	loads	of some	applications.

D	is	incorrect	because	elasticity	refers	to	the	ability	of	a	cloud	or application	environment	to	change	resources	as	demand	changes.	An application	or	service	must	be	designed	in	such	a	way	to	allow	for easy	expansion	of	resources,	and	implemented	in	such	a	way	that programmatic	means	can	be	used	to	do	so.

### [important] Question # 7 - Which	of	the	following	threat	types	is	mostly	likely	to	occur	as	a	result	of an	organization	moving	from	a	traditional	data	center	to	a	cloud environment?    
A.	Insufficient	due	diligence    
B.	Data	breach    
C.	Insecure	APIs   
D.	System	vulnerabilities    

Answer: A.	

When	an	organization	is	considering	moving	its	systems	and applications	from	a	traditional	data	center	model	to	a	cloud environment,	it	must	evaluate	a	lot	of	variables	and	factors	to determine	if	the	move	to	a	cloud	system	is	appropriate	or	feasible. Without	proper	and	thorough	evaluation	of	its	systems,	designs,	and controls,	an	organization	may	unintentionally	expose	itself	to	more security	risk	and	vulnerabilities	by	moving	to	a	cloud	environment.

B	is	incorrect	because	a	data	breach	occurs	when	there	is	an unauthorized	exposure	of	sensitive	or	private	data	to	a	party	that	is	not entitled	to	have	it.	This	can	occur	either	from	accidental	exposure	or from	hacking	or	other	malicious	activity.	Within	a	cloud	environment, because	of	multitenancy,	there	is	a	higher	exposure	and	risk	than	in	a traditional	data	center	with	isolated	systems.

C	is	incorrect	because	insecure	APIs	occur	when	there	are	not	proper controls	or	validation	of	services	utilizing	and	accessing	them.	Cloud environments	make	heavy	use	of	APIs	for	everything	from	consumer cloud	services	to	the	backbone	management,	automation,	and orchestration	of	the	cloud,	and	their	security	is	of	the	utmost importance.

D	is	incorrect	because	system	vulnerabilities	are	related	to	the patching,	configuration,	and	monitoring	of	all	IT	systems,	whether	in a	cloud	environment	or	not.	With	any	system	vulnerabilities,	threats can	be	expanded	to	other	services	by	gaining	unauthorized	exposure to	resources,	and	strong	policies	and	practices	are	needed	to	ensure compliance	with	configuration	and	patching	of	systems,	and monitoring	for	noncompliance	is	always	extremely	important.

### Question # 8 - Which	of	the	following	types	of	software	is	a	Type	2	hypervisor	dependent on	that	a	Type	1	hypervisor	isn’t?    
A.	VPN    
B.	Firewall    
C.	Operating	system    
D.	IDS    

Answer: C.	

**A	Type	2	hypervisor	runs	on	top	of	a	host	operating	system	as	a software	application,	and	then	the	virtual	machines	are	deployed within	it**.	
With	a	**Type	1	hypervisor**,	the	software	**is	tied	directly	to	the underlying	hardware**	**and	does	not	rely	on	a	host	operating	system	to function.**

A	is	incorrect	because	a	virtual	private	network	(VPN)	is	a	method	for securing	network	traffic	and	communications,	and	does	not	have	any impact	on	hypervisors	or	the	type	that	is	used.

B	is	incorrect	because	a	firewall	is	used	for	network	security	and	the limiting	of	traffic	across	a	network,	but	is	not	specifically	related	to	a hypervisor	or	the	type	of	hypervisor	used.

D	is	incorrect	because	an	intrusion	detection	system	(IDS)	is	a	network security	device	to	monitor	for	specific	types	of	traffic	or	patterns against	a	set	of	signatures	for	known	attacks	and	vulnerabilities.	It	is not	related	to,	or	dependent	on,	a	hypervisor	or	the	specific	type	of hypervisor	used.

### Question # 9 - Which	cloud	service	category	brings	with	it	the	most	expensive	startup costs,	but	also	the	lowest	costs	for	ongoing	support	and	maintenance	staff?   
A.	IaaS    
B.	SaaS    
C.	PaaS    
D.	DaaS    

Answer: B.	

**A	Software	as	a	Service	(SaaS)	solution	will	typically	have	the highest	startup	and	licensing	costs,	as	the	customer	is	buying	a	fully developed,	integrated,	secured,	and	production-ready	software application.**	
This	means	that	the	upfront	costs	are	directly	financial (and	not	as	staff	intensive	as	the	others),	but	over	its	lifetime	an	SaaS solution	will	have	the	lowest	costs	in	support	staff	and	maintenance because	the	cloud	provider	will	be	responsible	for	those	activities.

A	is	incorrect	because	Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS)	will	have	the lowest	financial	costs	upfront,	as	most	of	the	activities	related	to getting	a	system	up	and	running	involve	staff.	It	is	the	responsibility of	the	cloud	customer	to	configure	and	deploy	the	virtual	machines and	all	components,	but	also	the	application	and	its	security.	Over	the lifetime	of	the	hosting	arrangement,	the	staff	costs	will	be	the	highest with	IaaS	implementations,	while	the	actual	licensing	and	hosting costs	from	a	purely	financial	standpoint	will	be	the	lowest.

C	is	incorrect	because	Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS)	represents	a balance	between	upfront	financial	costs	and	licensing,	as	well	as	the staff	costs	on	behalf	of	the	cloud	customer.	With	PaaS,	the	cloud provider	delivers	the	virtual	machine,	with	the	application	framework and	dependencies	ready	to	use,	but	it	is	up	to	the	cloud	customer	to deploy,	secure,	and	test	its	software	applications	and	services.

D	is	incorrect	because	Desktop	as	a	Service	(DaaS)	is	very	similar	to PaaS,	in	that	the	cloud	provider	delivers	the	framework	and	platform, but	it	is	up	to	the	cloud	customer	to	deploy	and	configure	its	specific applications	and	services	that	will	run	within	the	framework.

### [very important] Question # 10 - Which	type	of	cloud	service	category	would	[having	a	vendor-neutral encryption	scheme]	for	data	at	rest	(DAR)	be	the	MOST	important?  
A.	Public   
B.	Hybrid   
C.	Private    
D.	Community    
Answer: B.	

**With	the	hybrid	cloud	category,	a	vendor-neutral	solution	for encryption	would	be	the	most	important	because	the	application	and data	would	span	more	than	one	cloud	provider.	
There	is	little	chance of	success	or	scalability	with	the	utilization	of	an	encryption	scheme from	one	cloud	provider,	and	it	wouldn’t	likely	port	or	work	well	with another.	By	using	a	vendor-neutral	solution,	a	cloud	customer	can maintain	maximum	flexibility	going	forward	with	a	hybrid	cloud solution**.

A	is	incorrect	because	a	public	cloud	solution	is	with	a	single	cloud provider,	which	might	provide	built-in	or	proprietary	encryption schemes	that	work	optimally	in	its	environment.	Care	needs	to	be taken	to	ensure	the	application	and	systems	do	not	get	effectively locked	into	that	provider	because	a	loss	of	portability	and interoperability	can	occur.

C	is	incorrect	because	many	private	cloud	solutions	offer	their	own encryption	schemes	that	are	designed	to	work	within	their environment.	Care	needs	to	be	taken	to	ensure	the	application	and systems	do	not	get	effectively	locked	into	one	provider	because	a	loss
of	portability	and	interoperability	can	occur.

D	is	incorrect	because	a	community	cloud	may	be	constructed	with toolsets	that	work	optimally	within	it	and	are	likely	geared	toward similar	organizations	and	needs.	Care	needs	to	be	taken	to	ensure	the application	and	systems	do	not	get	effectively	locked	into	one provider	because	a	loss	of	portability	and	interoperability	can	occur.

### Question # 11 - Although	encryption	can	help	an	organization	to	effectively	decrease	the possibility	of	data	breaches,	which	other	type	of	threat	can	it	increase	the chances	of?    
A.	Insecure	interfaces    
B.	Data	loss    
C.	System	vulnerabilities    
D.	Account	hijacking    

Answer: B.	

Data	loss	occurs	when	an	organization	either	loses	data	or	loses access	to	it.	This	is	different	from	a	data	breach,	where	it	is	exposed	to unauthorized	parties.	Although	the	use	of	encryption	will	serve	as	a strong	mitigation	against	data	breaches,	the	reliance	on	keys,	and access	to	them,	increases	the	possibility	of	data	loss.	If	the	keys	were to	be	lost	or	destroyed,	the	organization	would	lose	access	to	the	data.

A	is	incorrect	because	“insecure	interfaces”	refers	to	having	APIs	or other	services	improperly	secured,	and	thus	subject	to	being compromised	or	abused.	Insecure	interfaces	would	render	any application	and	its	data	less	secure	and	more	vulnerable,	and	as	such, would	not	fit	what	this	question	is	looking	for.

C	is	incorrect	because	system	vulnerabilities	would	always	lead	to	less secure	applications	and	data,	and	they	would	not	under	any circumstances	decrease	the	possibility	of	data	breaches.

D	is	incorrect	because	account	hijacking	refers	to	situations	where	an attacker	is	able	to	access	a	system	or	cloud	environment	through	a valid	account,	perhaps	not	even	on	the	same	application,	and	then	use that	access	to	eavesdrop	or	to	access	other	data.	This	is	not	unique	to	a cloud	environment,	but	due	to	multitenancy,	the	risk	level	is	higher and	not	under	control	of	an	individual	cloud	customer.

### Question # 12 - Which	of	the	following	auditing	or	reporting	types	pertains	ONLY	to financial	statements	and	reporting?     
A.	SOC	1    
B.	NIST	SP	800-53    
C.	SOC	2     
D.	FIPS	140-2     

Answer: A.	    

The	Service	Organization	Control	(SOC)	Type	1	reports	focus	on the	controls	in	place	at	an	organization	and	pertain	to	financial reporting	and	the	types	of	information	useful	with	a	financial	audit. SOC	1	focuses	on	the	management	structure	of	the	organization,	the target	customer	base,	and	the	regulations	that	an	audit	would	be guided	by	and	subjected	to.

B	is	incorrect	because	NIST	SP	800-53	is	on	security	controls	for	US federal	government	IT	systems,	with	the	exception	of	national	security systems,	and	serves	as	a	guide	for	federal	agencies	and	contractors	to conform	to	pertinent	law	and	regulations.	It	is	focused	exclusively	on government	systems,	and	although	it	forms	a	comprehensive framework	for	security,	some	elements	would	likely	be	difficult	for nongovernmental	systems	to	comply	with.

C	is	incorrect	because	SOC	Type	2	reports	are	structured	by	the	same organization	as	SOC	Type	1	reports.	They	go	beyond	just	a	review	of controls	and	information	pertinent	to	financial	reports	and	statements, and	include	five	additional	areas:	security,	availability,	processing integrity,	confidentiality,	and	privacy.

D	is	incorrect	because	FIPS	140-2	is	a	United	States	federal government	publication	that	is	focused	on	the	certification	and validation	of	cryptographic	modules,	and	does	not	pertain	to	financial statements	or	reports	in	any	way.

### [very important] Question # 13 - Which	of	the	following	[roles]	works	to	obtain	new	customers	and	secure contracts?     
A.	Cloud	service	manager     
B.	Cloud	service	broker      
C.	Cloud	service	deployment	manager     
D.	Cloud	service	business	manager     

Answer: B.	       

**The	cloud	service	broker	obtains	new	customers,	analyzes	the marketplace,	and	secures	contracts	and	agreements	for	cloud	services**.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	cloud	service	manager	delivers,	provisions, and	manages	cloud	services.
C	is	incorrect	because	the	cloud	service	deployment	manager	gathers metrics	on	cloud	services,	manages	deployment	steps	and	processes, and	defines	the	environment	and	processes.
D	is	incorrect	because	the	cloud	service	business	manager	oversees business	plans	and	customer	relationships,	as	well	as	processes financial	transactions.

### Question # 14 - Which	of	the	following	is	a	security	consideration	of	a	Type	2	hypervisor that	is	NOT	a	security	concern	of	a	Type	1	hypervisor?   
A.	Operating	system     
B.	Firewall    
C.	VLAN      
D.	Access	controls      

Answer: A.	

Rather	than	interacting	directly	with	the	underlying	hardware	as	a Type	1	hypervisor	does,	a	Type	2	hypervisor	runs	on	top	of	an operating	system.	This	creates	an	additional	layer	of	security considerations	because	the	security	of	the	host	operating	system	will also	impact	the	hypervisor	software,	and	the	hypervisor	is	susceptible to	any	security	vulnerabilities	or	threats	to	the	operating	system.	With a	Type	1	hypervisor,	there	is	no	additional	layer,	and	security	can	be tightly	controlled	by	the	vendor.

B	is	incorrect	because	firewalls,	and	their	impact	and	importance	on network	security,	would	not	be	affected	by	the	type	of	hypervisor employed	to	host	virtual	machines.

C	is	incorrect	because	VLANs	are	logical	network	segments	for organizing,	segregating,	and	assisting	with	network	security,	and would	not	be	impacted	by	the	type	of	hypervisor	being	used.

D	is	incorrect	because	access	controls	are	a	concern	of	all	hypervisors and	the	hosts	that	run	within	them,	and	would	not	be	impacted	by	the use	of	either	type	of	hypervisor.

### Question # 15 - Which	of	the	following	is	NOT	considered	an	effective	method	of mitigation	for	the	systems	vulnerability	threat?       
A.	Patching     
B.	Monitoring      
C.	Scanning      
D.	Virtualization       
Answer: D.	     

Virtualization	would	not	be	a	method	or	effective	tool	for	the mitigation	of	system	vulnerabilities.	When	running,	a	virtual	machine is	subjected	to	the	same	security	concerns	and	vulnerabilities	as	a physical	server	and	operating	system	would	be.	Additionally,	because the	virtual	machine	is	merely	an	image	residing	in	storage,	there	are extra	vulnerabilities	in	regard	to	securing	the	image,	and	the	reality	is that	an	image	can	be	attacked	or	compromised	even	when	not	running.

A	is	incorrect	because	patching	is	one	of	the	key	components	and	most effective	ways	for	mitigating	system	vulnerabilities.	As	security vulnerabilities	are	discovered,	vendors	publish	and	distribute	patches to	fix	or	mitigate	the	vulnerabilities	within	their	software.	By installing	these	patches	as	soon	as	possible,	administrators	can decrease	the	likeliness	of	their	systems	being	compromised.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	monitoring	of	systems	is	an	effective method	for	mitigating	and	limiting	system	vulnerabilities	and	threats. Monitoring	will	give	insight	into	the	types	of	threats	and	attacks	being employed	against	your	systems,	and	you	can	discover	when	a potential	exploit	may	have	been	successful	and	what	steps	can	be taken	to	contain	or	limit	any	damage.

C	is	incorrect	because	scanning	is	a	very	common	tool	used	to discover	any	vulnerabilities	on	systems	in	need	of	mitigation. Scanning	is	commonly	used	to	verify	that	patches	have	been	applied, as	well	as	to	verify	what	settings	and	configurations	have	been properly	implemented	to	limit	threats	and	to	disable	unnecessary services	and	access.

### Question # 16 - Most	modern	web-based	applications,	especially	those	hosted	within	a cloud	environment,	rely	heavily	on	web	services	and	consumable resources.	Which	of	the	following	is	the	most	widely	used	security protocol	to	protect	these	types	of	technologies?    
A.	IPSec     
B.	VPN     
C.	HTTPS       
D.	SSH      
Answer: C.	      

The	Hypertext	Transfer	Protocol	Secure	(HTTPS)	is	the	most commonly	used	protocol	for	securing	communications	and applications	within	a	cloud	environment,	especially	as	most	are	webbased	systems.	HTTPS	extends	the	traditional	HTTP	protocol	used	for web	communications	by	adding	security	protocols	and	encryption.

A	is	incorrect	because	although	IPSec	is	a	commonly	used	method	for securing	communications,	it	is	not	used	nearly	on	the	same	scale	as HTTPS.	It	is	also	used	for	server-to-server	communications,	adds substantial	load	to	systems,	and	is	not	a	method	used	for	customer communications	at	all.

B	is	incorrect	because	VPNs	are	often	used	for	administrative	and support	communications;	they	are	not	commonly	used	for	security web	services.	In	situations	where	a	VPN	is	used	to	protect communications,	HTTPS	is	still	almost	always	used	in	conjunction with	it.

D	is	incorrect	because	SSH	is	used	for	obtaining	secure	shell	access	to servers	for	administration	and	application	support.	In	PaaS	and	SaaS service	categories,	the	cloud	customer	will	typically	not	have	server access	either.	SSH	is	not	commonly	used	to	secure	web	services.

### Question # 17 - Your	company	is	focused	on	software	development,	and	your	main	focus is	keeping	the	costs	of	development	as	low	as	possible	to	maximize	profit. Which	cloud	service	category	would	be	the	most	appropriate	to	use	for this	goal?     
A.	Infrastructure      
B.	Software      
C.	Platform      
D.	Desktop      
Answer: C.	

**With	the	Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS)	service	category,	a development	company	can	focus	exclusively	on	software	development and	deployment,	rather	than	having	to	maintain,	install,	or	configure hosting	systems.	It	also	would	enable	a	development	team	to	quickly try	out	different	hosting	platforms	or	cloud	providers	to	find	what works	best	for	their	applications**.

A	is	incorrect	because	although	the	startup	costs	with	the	cloud provider	will	be	lower	for	Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS)	than	with PaaS,	the	costs	with	staff	and	time	to	build,	install,	configure,	and secure	virtual	machines	will	be	enormous.	Having	to	build	out	and maintain	infrastructure	would	take	the	developers	away	from	their core	focus.

B	is	incorrect	because	Software	as	a	Service	(SaaS)	offers	a	full application	for	a	cloud	customer,	not	something	where	development would	be	done	(or	even	could	be	done).

D	is	incorrect	because	Desktop	as	a	Service	(DaaS)	would	not	be appropriate	for	development	and	deployment,	as	it	is	intended	to	host desktop	applications	in	a	cloud	environment.

### Question # 18 - Which	of	the	following	aspects	of	cloud	computing	makes	data	in	transit(DIT)	between	internal	servers	more	of	a	risk	than	in	a	traditional	data center?       
A.	Multitenancy    
B.	Portability     
C.	Interoperability     
D.	Broad	network	access      
Answer: A.	

Multitenancy,	within	a	cloud	environment,	means	having	different customers,	systems,	and	applications,	all	within	the	same	physical systems	and	networks.	
Even	with	the	use	of	secure	communications and	encryption,	this	poses	an	additional	risk	above	a	traditional	data center	because	any	compromise	or	malicious	intent	from	one	system could	impact	the	other	systems.	Threats	such	as	eavesdropping	and internal	attacks	are	a	major	concern	with	cloud	computing	and multitenancy.

B	is	incorrect	because	portability	refers	to	the	capability	to	easily move	between	different	cloud	providers	and	hosting	arrangements.	It does	not	pose	any	security	concerns	in	relation	to	data	in	transit,	no with	any	production	runtime	systems.

C	is	incorrect	because	interoperability	refers	to	the	capability	of reusing	and	repurposing	components	and	services.	It	gives	an organization	the	ability	to	quickly	deploy	different	applications	and make	modular	components	to	assist	with	rapid	development.	As	a capability,	it	does	not	pose	any	security	concerns	with	data	in	transit or	runtime	environments.

D	is	incorrect	because	broad	network	access	refers	to	the	capability	of accessing	cloud	services	from	any	location	and	from	a	variety	of devices.	This	would	be	similar	to	accessing	of	services	within	a traditional	data	center,	but	does	not	necessarily	pose	additional security	concerns	by	itself	in	the	way	that	multitenancy	can	expose potential	internal	attacks	from	other	compromised	systems.

### Question # 19 - Data	is	modified	from	its	original	form	by	an	application	or	user.	Which phase	of	the	cloud	secure	data	lifecycle	would	this	action	be	classified under?           
A.	Use     
B.	Share     
C.	Archive      
D.	Modify     
Answer: A.	    

During	the	“use”	phase	of	the	cloud	secure	data	lifecycle,	the	data is	consumed	and	possibly	modified	from	its	original	form	by	an application,	either	via	programmatic	means	or	by	the	direct	actions	of a	user	of	the	application.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	“share”	phase	of	the	cloud	secure	data lifecycle	entails	the	data	being	available	to	view	by	users,	customers, administrators,	or	other	services.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	“archive”	phase	of	the	cloud	secure	data lifecycle	pertains	to	the	data	being	removed	from	active	access	and availability	and	then	placed	into	a	static	state	where	it	is	preserved	for a	predefined	period	of	time.

**D	is	incorrect	because	“modify”	is	not	a	phase	of	the	cloud	secure	data lifecycle**.	The	concepts	that	would	most	likely	be	placed	under	such	a heading	are	already	found	in	the	“use”	phase.

### [very important] Question # 20 - In	a	cloud	environment,	many	[different	users	and	organizations	have access	to	the	same	resources],	and	the	cloud	provider	has	systems	staff [who	have	access	to	storage	systems	where	virtual	machine	images	are housed].	Which	of	the	following,	based	on	that	information,	is	necessary	to protect	and	isolate	data	to	only	those	authorized?       
A.	Encryption     
B.	Sandboxing     
C.	VLANs     
D.	Reversibility          
Answer: A.	

**With	resource	pooling	and	multitenancy,	as	well	as	the	support	staff of	the	cloud	provider	having	privileged	access	throughout	the	entire environment,	encryption	is	of	particular	importance	to	protect	data**. 
**With	the	keys	under	the	control	of	the	cloud	customer,	even	if	a system	is	compromised,	the	data	will	be	protected,	which	would	also apply	to	virtual	images	that	could	be	accessed	via	storage	systems**.

B	is	incorrect	because	sandboxing	is	a	way	of	segregating	systems	or applications	for	testing	or	security	reasons,	but	would	not	provide additional	protection	for	data	on	systems.	It	is	mostly	used	to	keep web	services	from	interacting	and	to	keep	production	and	nonproduction	systems	from	mixing	together.

C	is	incorrect	because	VLANs	are	used	for	logical	network segregations,	and	although	they	can	be	used	to	provide	additional security	at	the	network	level,	they	would	not	provide	any	additional security	to	data	and	storage	methods.

D	is	incorrect	because	reversibility	refers	to	the	ability	of	a	cloud customer	to	remove	all	applications	and	data	from	a	cloud environment,	along	with	assurances	from	the	cloud	provider	that everything	was	securely	removed	from	its	systems.	This	does	not pertain	to	the	security	of	data	during	a	hosting	arrangement.

### Question # 21 - Which	of	the	following	data	sanitation	methods	would	be	the	MOST effective	if	you	needed	to	securely	remove	data	as	quickly	as	possible	in	a cloud	environment?    
A.	Zeroing     
B.	Cryptographic	erasure    
C.	Overwriting    
D.	Degaussing   
Answer: B.	   

**Cryptographic	erasure	works	by	destroying	the	keys	that	were	used to	encrypt	the	data.	Although	it	does	not	delete	the	data	in	a	traditional sense,	with	the	keys	destroyed,	the	data	is	unreadable	and unrecoverable,	thus	giving	the	same	effect**.	
**Because	the	focus	is	on	the destruction	of	keys,	it	is	also	something	that	can	be	done	very	quickly and	with	minimal	effort,	whereas	deleting	large	volumes	of	data	and then	verifying	it	has	been	deleted	can	be	a	very	time-consuming process**.

A	is	incorrect	because	zeroing	data	refers	to	overwriting	all	data sectors	with	null	values.	Within	a	traditional	data	center	with	physical hardware,	this	is	typically	possible,	but	within	a	cloud	environment and	the	way	data	is	very	dispersed,	or	in	the	case	of	object	storage housed	externally,	zeroing	data	may	not	be	possible.	Even	if	it	is
possible,	the	process	is	very	long,	time	consuming,	and	resource intensive.

C	is	incorrect	because	overwriting	refers	to	the	replacement	of	valid data	with	garbage	or	random	values,	in	order	to	verify	that	the	data has	been	completely	destroyed.	Depending	on	the	access	and	cloud configuration,	overwriting	may	not	even	be	possible	in	a	cloud environment—and	even	if	it	is	available,	the	process	would	be extremely	resource	intensive	and	time	consuming.

D	is	incorrect	because	degaussing	refers	to	the	demagnetizing	of physical	storage	media.	Although	this	is	possible	in	a	traditional	data center,	where	an	organization	owns	the	media	and	can	do	so, degaussing	would	not	be	possible	in	a	cloud	environment	at	all.

### [important] Question # 22 - Which	of	the	following	descriptions	of	a	Type	1	Hypervisor	is	MOST correct?     
A.	It	runs	on	as	an	application	on	top	of	an	operating	system	to	hostvirtual	machines.     
B.	It	runs	on	a	separate	management	server	and	interacts	with	a virtualization	appliance.     
C.	It	runs	directly	on	top	of	the	hardware	and	serves	as	the	sole	layer between	the	hardware	and	virtual	machines.    
D.	It	runs	directly	on	top	of	the	hardware	and	runs	an	additional	software layer	to	host	virtual	machines.   
Answer: C.	

**A	Type	1	hypervisor	runs	directly	on	top	of	the	underlying hardware	and	is	tightly	tied	to	it,	with	both	hardware	and	software from	the	same	vendor**.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	answer	is	describing	a	Type	2	hypervisor that	runs	on	top	of	an	operating	system,	not	one	tied	directly	to	the underlying	hardware.

B	is	incorrect	because	it	does	not	describe	a	Type	1	or	Type	2 hypervisor.

D	is	incorrect	because	although	a	Type	1	hypervisor	does	run	directly on	top	of	the	hardware,	it	does	not	need	an	additional	software	layer	to host	virtual	machines.

### Question # 23 - When	a	user	accesses	a	system,	what	process	determines	the	roles	and privileges	that	user	is	granted	within	the	application?    
A.	Authorization   
B.	Authentication    
C.	Provisioning   
D.	Privilege  
Answer: A.	

**Authorization	is	the	process	by	which	a	user	is	granted	roles	and access	to	an	application,	after	successfully	completing	the authentication	process**.	It	is	typically	based	on	group	and	role memberships.

B	is	incorrect	because	authentication	is	the	process	where	a	user proves	and	validates	his	identity,	but	it	does	not	confer	access	or	roles.

C	is	incorrect	because	provisioning	is	the	process	where	a	user	is identified	and	proven	to	a	system	in	order	to	acquire	authentication credentials	and	access.

D	is	incorrect	because	privilege	refers	to	a	level	of	access	a	user	has within	a	system,	but	it’s	a	result	of	the	authorization	process.

### Question # 24 - Which	of	the	following	technologies	has	been	deprecated	and	deemed unsafe	to	use	for	secure	communications	and	data?     
A.	TLS   
B.	AES   
C.	DNS   
D.	SSL     
Answer: D.

**Secure	sockets	layer	(SSL)	version	3.0	was	deprecated**	in	June	2015 by	RFC	7568	because	it	was	considered	insecure,	and	admins	were instructed	to	move	systems	to	TLS.

A	is	incorrect	because	Transport	Socket	Layer	(TLS)	has	replaced	SSL and	is	now	the	standard	security	for	network	and	web communications.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	Advanced	Encryption	Standard	(AES)	is	a type	of	modern	encryption,	and	many	ciphers	are	used	with	TLS	for securing	communications.

C	is	incorrect	because	Domain	Name	Service	(DNS)	is	a	protocol	for mapping	common	names	to	IP	addresses	for	network communications;	it	is	not	a	security	protocol	or	used	to	protect	actual communications.

### Question # 25 - Which	concept	pertains	to	cloud	customers	paying	only	for	the	resources they	use	and	consume,	and	only	for	the	duration	they	are	using	them?       
A.	Measured	service           
B.	Auto-scaling    
C.	Portability     
D.	Elasticity    
Answer: A.	

Measured	service	refers	to	cloud	customers	paying	only	for	the resources	they	consume,	and	only	for	the	time	they	are	consuming them.	This	would	typically	refer	to	the	building	blocks	of	cloud computing:	CPU,	memory,	storage,	and	possibly	network.	This	differs from	a	traditional	data	center,	where	an	organization	would	need	to have	all	resources	available	at	all	times.

B	is	incorrect	because	auto-scaling	refers	to	the	ability	of	a	cloud provider	to	automatically	and	programmatically	alter	the	resources allocated	to	a	particular	application,	based	on	its	current	demands	and load.	Although	it	certainly	plays	a	crucial	role	with	measured	service, it	is	a	distinctly	different	process	and	one	that	is	not	required,	or enabled,	with	all	cloud	applications.

C	is	incorrect	because	portability	refers	to	the	capability	of	a	cloudbased	system	or	application	to	easily	move	between	cloud	providers, and	does	not	play	a	direct	role	in	anything	regarding	billing	or payments	for	services.

D	is	incorrect	because	elasticity	is	the	capability	of	a	cloud-based application	to	grow	to	meet	current	demands	in	an	easy,	and	typically in	a	programmatic	manner.	It	does	not	relate	to	billing	for	services, though	the	invocation	of	elasticity	based	on	load	would	lead	to	a change	in	billing	and	charges	for	services.

### Question # 26 - Which	of	the	following	aspects	of	cloud	computing	is	a	more	prominent feature	of	PaaS	versus	IaaS?      
A.	Availability    
B.	Auto-scaling     
C.	Portability    
D.	Broad	network	access    
Answer: B.	    

With	PaaS	offering	a	full	platform	and	framework,	and	just	needing application	code	and	data	to	function,	auto-scaling	is	a	prominent
feature	of	the	service	category,	and	it’s	typically	the	service	category being	discussed	with	the	topic.

A	is	incorrect	because	availability	pertains	to	all	cloud	service categories	and	would	not	be	a	prominent	feature	of	one	over	the	other.

C	is	incorrect	because	portability	refers	to	being	able	to	easily	move from	one	cloud	environment	to	another,	and	it	applies	to	all	cloud service	categories.

D	is	incorrect	because	broad	network	access	is	one	of	the	core concepts	of	cloud	computing	and	applies	to	all	cloud	service categories	equally.

### [important] Question # 27 - Which	role,	on	behalf	of	the	cloud	customer,	is	responsible	for	the	testing of	cloud	services?      
A.	Cloud	service	user     
B.	Cloud	service	administrator        
C.	Cloud	service	business	manager          
D.	Cloud	service	integrator       
Answer: B.	     

One	of	the	key	tasks	of	the	cloud	service	administrator	is	to	test cloud	services,	but	also	to	monitor	services,	administer	security	of services,	provide	usage	reports,	and	address	problem	reports.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	cloud	service	user	is	the	consumer	of	cloud services	that	are	offered	by	the	cloud	customer	or	provider.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	cloud	service	business	manager	oversees business	and	billing	administration,	as	well	as	purchases	cloud services	and	requests	audit	reports,	as	necessary.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	cloud	service	integrator	is	responsible	for connecting	and	integrating	existing	systems	and	services	within	a cloud	environment.

### Question # 28 - Your	company	has	undertaken	a	full	study	of	moving	services	to	a	cloud environment,	but	due	to	budget	constraints,	the	project	has	been	delayed. You	now	have	received	budget	money	and	a	demand	that	the	cloud services	be	set	up	as	soon	as	possible.	Which	cloud	service	category would	be	your	best	option	under	the	circumstances?      
A.	Private    
B.	Community    
C.	Hybrid    
D.	Public    
Answer: D.	

**Public	cloud	services	are	the	quickest	and	easiest	to	set	up	and begin	using**.	
Most	public	cloud	systems	will	be	totally	automated	from a	self-service	portal,	with	only	the	need	for	a	credit	card	to	establish an	account	and	begin	allocating	resources.

A	is	incorrect	because	a	private	cloud	would	be	offered	by	an organization	for	its	own	internal	services,	or	it	would	something	that’s procured	via	contract	with	a	provider.	It	is	not	something	that	could	be established	as	quickly	and	easily	as	a	public	cloud	would.

B	is	incorrect	because	a	community	cloud	is	established	by	similar organization	to	meet	their	common	goals.	It	would	not	be	something that	an	organization	could	easily	or	quickly	join	like	it	could	with	a public	cloud.

C	is	incorrect	because	a	hybrid	cloud	spans	multiple	hosting	providers and	adds	additional	complexity,	and	would	not	be	something	an organization	could	quickly	establish	and	begin	using.

### Question # 29 - What	is	the	main	drawback	to	having	a	remote	key	management	service in	production	use,	versus	a	local	one?     
A.	The	cloud	provider	will	have	full	control	over	the	keys.     
B.	The	software	may	be	insecure.     
C.	Availability	is	crucial.    
D.	Incompatibility	issues.    
Answer: C.	

**A	remote	key	service	is	one	that	is	hosted	apart	and	away	from	the applications	and	systems**.	
**This	gives	an	organization	much	greater control	over	its	keys	and	key	practices,	and	also	allows	a	great	degree of	portability**.	
**However,	having	the	keys	kept	apart	from	the	hosting provider	and	applications	also	means	that	availability	is	crucial**.	
**If	the key	system	were	to	become	unavailable	or	unreachable,	the	systems and	applications	that	rely	on	these	keys	would	effectively	be	down	as far	as	the	users	are	concerned	because	they	would	be	unable	to function**.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	entire	premise	of	having	a	remote	key management	system	is	for	the	cloud	customer	to	maintain	control	over the	keys,	usage,	and	signing	practices.

B	is	incorrect	because	regardless	of	whether	the	key	management system	is	local	or	remote,	the	same	security	considerations	would apply.

D	is	incorrect	because	compatibility	concerns	are	an	issue	for	any service,	whether	it	is	hosted	locally	or	remotely,	and	neither	solution would	give	an	inherent	benefit	over	the	other	concerning compatibility.

### [important] Question # 30 - Which	cloud	service	category	is	MOST	likely	to	use	a	client-side	key management	system?    
A.	IaaS    
B.	SaaS    
C.	PaaS   
D.	DaaS   
Answer: B.	

A	client-side	key	management	system	is	one	where	the	software	for the	key	management	system	is	supplied	by	the	cloud	provider	but hosted	and	run	from	a	location	chosen	by	the	cloud	customer.	This	is most	common	with	SaaS	implementations,	as	the	cloud	provider would	need	to	supply	the	software	to	ensure	compatibility	with	the application.

A	is	incorrect	because	a	client-side	key	management	system	would	be least	likely	with	an	IaaS	implementation,	as	it	would	be	incumbent	on the	cloud	customer	to	pick	and	implement	its	own	toolsets	and practices.

C	is	incorrect	because	a	client-side	key	management	system	is	one typically	tied	closely	to	an	application,	and	with	a	PaaS implementation,	although	the	cloud	provider	is	supplying	the framework	and	hosting	environment,	the	actual	application	and	code are	provided	by	the	cloud	customer	and	are	its	responsibility.

D	is	incorrect	because	DaaS	would	typically	look	and	perform	similar to	a	PaaS	implementation,	where	the	cloud	provider	is	responsible	for supplying	the	platform	and	framework,	but	not	the	actual	application or	toolset.

### [important] Question # 31 - Which	of	the	following	is	NOT	part	of	the	determination	of	the	account provisioning	process?     
A.	Regulations     
B.	Contracts    
C.	Organizational	policies    
D.	Privacy	notices    
Answer: D.	  

Privacy	notices	are	publicly	posted,	on	a	website	typically,	and disclose	to	the	users	of	the	site	how	their	information	is	collected	and used.	They	are	not	part	of	the	account	provisioning	process	at	all	and would	have	no	bearing	on	it.

A	is	incorrect	because	regulations	can	play	a	central	role	in	account provisioning.	Many	regulatory	frameworks	have	specific	requirements for	how	users	must	be	validated	prior	to	having	credentials provisioned,	including	the	information	they	must	present	or	what	kind of	background	check	must	be	completed.

B	is	incorrect	because	contracts	will	typically	play	a	key	role	in account	provisioning.	Going	beyond	regulatory	requirements, contracts	often	articulate	and	document	who	is	to	be	granted	access, how	they	will	be	verified,	and	what	level	and	type	of	access	they	are provisioned.

C	is	incorrect	because	organizational	policies	also	play	a	key	role	in account	provisioning.	Policies	may	dictate	to	whom	credentials	are provisioned,	as	well	was	what	the	process	is,	what	must	be	verified, and	how	long	credentials	are	valid	for.

### [important] Question # 32 - Which	of	the	following	threats	against	a	system	is	the	MOST	difficult	to mitigate	when	the	cloud	service	category	is	removed	as	part	of	the consideration?    
A.	Insufficient	due	diligence     
B.	Malicious	insiders     
C.	Account	hijacking    
D.	Data	loss   
Answer: B.	

**Malicious	insiders	are	typically	individuals	who	have	valid	access and	authorization	to	a	system,	application,	or	data,	and	then	use	that valid	access	for	reasons	outside	the	intended	purpose**.	
It	is	especially difficult	to	mitigate	against	malicious	insiders	because	they	have	valid credentials	and	authorization	for	what	they	are	accessing,	and	are using	it	for	inappropriate	purposes.

A	is	incorrect	because	insufficient	due	diligence	occurs	when	an organization	does	not	properly	plan	or	evaluate	IT	systems	for configurations,	vulnerabilities,	security,	monitoring,	and	so	on.	This can	lead	to	insufficient	controls	or	misconfigurations,	resulting	in vulnerabilities	or	performance	problems.

C	is	incorrect	because	account	hijacking	refers	to	an	attacker	gaining access	to	a	system	through	valid	credentials	and	then	using	those credentials	to	launch	attacks	or	attempt	to	compromise	other	systems within	the	same	infrastructure	as	the	launching	pad.	Other countermeasures,	such	as	multifactor	authentication,	can	be	employed to	largely	mitigate	the	chances	of	account	hijacking	from	occurring.

D	is	incorrect	because	data	loss	refers	to	a	situation	where	an organization	loses	actual	data	or	loses	access	to	it.	This	most commonly	occurs	when	data	is	deleted	or	hardware	fails	and	backups have	not	been	performed,	but	it	can	also	occur	with	encrypted	data should	the	keys	become	lost	or	corrupted	without	backup.

### [important] Question # 33 - Which	of	the	following	[methods	of	attack],	used	in	a	[SaaS]	environment, poses	the	biggest	threat	to	the	exposure	of	data	across	different customers?  
A.	DDoS  
B.	XSS   
C.	JSON    
D.	XSLT   
Answer: B.	

[important] **Cross-site	scripting	(XSS)	poses	a	big	risk	with	any	environment, but	especially	within	a	SaaS	implementation,	where	it	is	very	likely that	data	from	multiple	customers	is	housed	and	accessible	within	the same	software	application**.

A	is	incorrect	because	a	distributed	denial	of	service	(DDoS)	attack	is against	the	availability	of	a	system	or	application,	not	against	the confidentiality	of	its	data.

C	is	incorrect	because	JavaScript	Object	Notation	(JSON)	is	a	datainterchange	format	that	is	often	used	with	web	services.	It	is	not	a security	measure,	nor	is	it	focused	on	data	confidentiality.

D	is	incorrect	because	Extensible	Stylesheet	Language
Transformations	(XSLT)	is	used	for	transforming	documents	in	XML
format	to	other	formats,	and	is	not	used	for	security	or	data confidentiality	processes.

### [important] Question # 34 - Which	concept	is	focused	on	ensuring	that	users	are	given	the	appropriate rights	to	data	and	functions	within	an	application?    
A.	Authentication   
B.	Authorization   
C.	Privilege    
D.	Provisioning    
Answer: B.	

Authorization,	performed	after	successful	authentication,	is	the process	by	which	appropriate	roles	and	permissions	are	granted	to	the user	or	service	account.	This	is	based	on	the	attributes	of	the	account holders,	such	as	group	membership,	employment	status,	location,	or any	other	type	of	variable,	and	then	is	matched	against	roles	for access.

A	is	incorrect	because	authentication	is	the	process	by	which	a	user	or service	proves	its	identity	to	a	system	or	application	based	on	its specific	requirements.

C	is	incorrect	because	privilege	refers	to	elevated	(typically administrative)	access	within	a	system	or	application.

D	is	incorrect	because	provisioning	is	the	process	by	which	credentials are	verified	and	proven,	and	then	an	authentication	object	or	token	is granted	for	access.

### Question # 35 - Which	of	the	following	concepts	would	MOST	likely	apply	specifically	to a	private	cloud	deployment	model?      
A.	Portability    
B.	Reversibility    
C.	Ownership   
D.	Resource	pooling   
Answer: C.	

Within	the	private	cloud	service	category,	in	many	circumstance	the cloud	will	be	owned	by	the	organization,	or	done	via	a	contract,	where a	level	of	ownership	is	maintained	over	hardware,	systems,	or processes	that	would	not	be	available	with	other	cloud	service categories.

A	is	incorrect	because	portability	is	a	key	cloud	concept	that	pertains to	the	ability	to	move	services	and	applications	between	different cloud	providers,	and	it	applies	to	any	service	category	or	hosting model	and	is	not	different	with	a	private	cloud	versus	other	models.

B	is	incorrect	because	reversibility	is	a	key	cloud	concept	that	pertains to	the	ability	to	easily	and	comprehensively	remove	applications	and data	from	a	cloud	environment,	and	it	applies	to	any	cloud deployment	model.

D	is	incorrect	because	resource	pooling	is	one	of	the	key characteristics	of	cloud	computing	that	relates	to	the	aggregate	system sources	and	their	allocation	among	different	customers	and	services;	it does	not	pertain	to	a	specific	cloud	deployment	model.

### Question # 36 - Which	of	the	following	concepts	pertains	to	the	ability	to	[verify]	that proper	controls	and	policies	are	in	place	on	a	system	or	application?    
A.	Auditability   
B.	Governance   
C.	Regulation   
D.	Elasticity    
Answer: A.	

Auditing	is	a	process	of	testing	and	verifying	the	security	controls and	configurations	in	place	on	a	system	or	application	and	then comparing	them	to	the	requirements	from	regulations	or	configuration baselines	that	define	what	they	should	be.	How	easy	or	difficult	this type	of	testing	and	verification	on	a	system	is	to	complete	is	the auditability	of	that	system.

B	is	incorrect	because	governance	refers	to	the	connection	between	IT management	and	the	business	focus	of	a	company	and	ensuring	that resources	and	configurations	are	allocated	with	an	eye	toward business	needs.	The	distinction	between	governance	and	auditability	is that	the	latter	is	focused	on	security	controls	and	configurations	based on	regulations	or	baselines,	not	on	the	specific	business	needs	used	to define	them.

C	is	incorrect	because	regulation	pertains	to	requirements	that	an organization	must	follow	based	on	the	type	and	usage	of	its	particular data,	and	it	is	governed	by	the	pertinent	jurisdiction	where	the organization	is	located.	Regulations	will	typically	be	used	to	form	the basis	of	audits	and	guidelines	for	the	implementation	of	security controls	and	system	configurations.

D	is	incorrect	because	elasticity	refers	to	the	ability	of	a	cloud	system to	dynamically	change	the	resources	available	to	a	system	or application	based	on	its	current	needs;	it	does	not	pertain	to	the
auditing	or	evaluation	of	controls	in	any	way.

### Question # 37 - Which	security	certification	serves	as	a	general	framework	that	can	be applied	to	any	type	of	system	or	application?    
A.	ISO/IEC	27001    
B.	PCI	DSS    
C.	FIPS	140-2    
D.	NIST	SP	800-53    
Answer: A.	

The	ISO/IEC	27001	standard,	and	its	most	current	iteration ISO/IEC	27001:2013,	serves	as	a	general	security	framework	for	any type	of	system	or	application,	regardless	of	its	purpose	and	specific type	of	data.	It	is	widely	considered	the	“gold	standard”	for international	security	certification,	even	if	it	is	does	not	specifically pertain	to	cloud	computing.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	Payment	Card	Industry	Data	Security Standard	(PCI	DSS)	is	a	standard	developed	and	enforced	by	the major	credit	card	companies	for	systems	that	interact	with	their networks	and	process	transitions	under	their	auspices.	It	is	specific	to these	types	of	systems	and	data	and	is	not	a	general	framework	for	IT security.

C	is	incorrect	because	FIPS	140-2	is	a	US	federal	government certification	standard	for	cryptographic	modules.	It	is	focused specifically	on	that	use	and	purpose	and	is	not	a	general	framework for	systems.

D	is	incorrect	because	NIST	SP	800-53	is	a	publication	for	US government	security	requirements	for	all	government	IT	systems,	with the	exception	of	national	security	systems.	It	is	not	intended	for	a general	framework	for	security	and	only	pertains	to	government systems	within	the	United	States.

### Question # 38 - Which	group	developed,	maintains,	and	controls	the	PCI	DSS	standardsand	controls? 
A.	NIST    
B.	ISO/IEC    
C.	EU    
D.	Credit	card	companies    
Answer: D.	

The	PCI	DSS	standards	were	developed	and	are	enforced	by	the
major	credit	card	companies	and	pertain	to	the	systems	that	interact with	their	networks	and	process	transactions	on	their	behalf.

A	is	incorrect	because	although	the	NIST,	part	of	the	US	federal government,	does	publish	many	pertinent	security	standards	and regulations,	it	does	not	publish	the	PCI	DSS	standards,	or	any	other standard	pertaining	to	proprietary	financial	transactions.

B	is	incorrect	because	although	the	joint	commission	between	the International	Organization	for	Standardization	(ISO)	and	the International	Electrotechnical	Commission	(IEC)	does	publish	many pertinent	security	standards	and	regulations,	it	does	not	publish	the PCI	DSS	standards	or	any	other	standard	pertaining	to	proprietary financial	transactions.

C	is	incorrect	because	although	the	European	Union	(EU)	does	publish many	pertinent	security	standards	and	regulations,	it	does	not	publish the	PCI	DSS	standards	or	any	other	standard	pertaining	to	proprietary financial	transactions.

### Question # 39 - Which	cloud	service	category	offers	the	most	customization	options	and control	to	the	cloud	customer?    
A.	PaaS    
B.	IaaS     
C.	SaaS    
D.	DaaS    
Answer: B.	

The	Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS)	category	allows	for	the	most customization	and	control	by	the	cloud	customer;	the	cloud	provider merely	provides	the	virtualized	environment	to	deploy	virtual machines	and	virtual	network	devices	within,	but	then	leaves	it	to	the cloud	customer	to	deploy	and	configure	those	specific	items.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS)	category provides	the	operating	system	and	application	framework	to	the	cloud customer,	who	then	only	deploys	and	configures	the	applications within	it.	PaaS	does	not	have	the	same	level	of	customization available	as	IaaS.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	Software	as	a	Service	(SaaS)	category provides	a	full	application	to	the	cloud	customer,	where	the	only	level of	customization	available	is	typically	some	branding	or	default settings	for	users.

D	is	incorrect	because	Desktop	as	a	Service	(DaaS)	is	very	similar	to the	PaaS	service	category,	where	the	framework	is	provided	within which	to	deploy	applications.	DaaS	does	not	have	the	same	level	of customization	available	as	IaaS.

### Question # 40 - The	NIST	Cloud	Technology	Roadmap	contains	a	component	focused	on the	minimum	requirements	to	meet	satisfactory	contractual	obligations between	the	cloud	provider	and	cloud	customer.	Which	of	the	following encapsulates	this	concept?     
A.	Accountability     
B.	Governance    
C.	SLA    
D.	Auditing    
Answer: C.	

The	service	level	agreement	(SLA)	forms	the	basis	for	evaluating control	compliance	between	the	cloud	customer	and	cloud	provider.	It documents	and	articulates	specific	requirements	for	availability, processes,	customer	service,	support,	security	controls,	auditing, reporting,	and	any	other	area	deemed	important	by	company	policy	or regulation	from	the	cloud	customer.

A	is	incorrect	because	although	accountability	refers	to	circumstances similar	to	the	ones	the	SLA	covers	(specifically	meeting	obligations and	response	times),	it	is	not	a	facet	of	the	NIST	Cloud	Technology Roadmap.

B	is	incorrect	because	governance	refers	to	the	connection	between	IT management	and	the	business	focus	of	a	company,	and	ensuring	that resources	and	configurations	are	done	with	an	eye	toward	business needs.	The	distinction	between	it	and	auditability	is	that	the	latter	is focused	on	security	controls	and	configurations	based	on	regulations or	baselines,	not	on	the	specific	business	needs	that	were	used	to define	them.

D	is	incorrect	because	auditing	refers	to	the	process	of	testing	and evaluating	system	controls	and	configurations	against	regulatory requirements	or	policy,	but	not	the	performance	metrics	or	response times	that	would	be	included	with	an	SLA.

### [important] Question # 41 - For	optimal	security,	where	should	the	authorization	process	of	user access	and	permissions	be	performed?     
A.	Account	provisioning    
B.	Throughout	use	of	the	application    
C.	Immediately	after	authentication    
D.	As	part	of	the	change	management	process    
Answer: B.	

Although	initial	authorization	decisions	are	made	when	a	user authenticates	to	an	application,	optimally	they	should	be	reevaluated as	the	user	accesses	different	functions	or	data	within	the	application. This	will	prevent	attacks	where	users	may	find	ways	to	elevate privileges	after	authentication,	and	it	also	catches	cases	where	a	user’s access	may	have	changed	since	he	initially	authenticated.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	account	provisioning	process	is	where	the user’s	identity	is	provided	and	verified	to	get	authentication credentials	issued.	It	does	not	play	a	role	in	the	authorization	of	a	user as	he	accesses	an	application	or	data.

C	is	incorrect	because	authorization	will	typically	be	performed	upon successful	authentication,	but	doing	so	only	at	that	point	leaves	data susceptible	to	elevation-of-privilege	attacks,	and	therefore	it	is	not	an optimal	solution.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	change	management	process	may	be	used	to grant	roles	and	access	initially,	especially	in	the	case	of	privileged	or administrative	users,	but	it	would	not	play	any	role	in	system operations	as	that	access	is	being	used.

### Question # 42 - Which	of	the	following	would	NOT	be	a	reason	a	customer	could	be “locked	in”	to	a	particular	cloud	provider?    
A.	Software	versions    
B.	Developers    
C.	Application	environments    
D.	Regulations    
Answer: B.	

A	customer	can	become	“locked	in”	to	a	particular	cloud	provider for	a	variety	of	reasons,	but	the	developers	who	are	responsible	for their	code	and	applications	would	not	be	such	a	reason.	Applications are	designed	to	work	within	specific	frameworks	or	technologies,	not with	specific	hosting	providers.

A	is	incorrect	because	if	a	specific	software	version	is	required,	this would	limit	the	customer	to	only	cloud	service	providers	that	offer that	specific	software	and	version.	Depending	on	how	specific	or	rare
the	required	software	version	is,	a	cloud	customer	could	be	limited	to a	small	number	of	cloud	providers,	or	even	to	a	single	cloud	provider.

C	is	incorrect	because	application	environments	are	required	to	run code	and	runtimes,	and	being	dependent	on	a	specific	one	can	lock	an organization	into	specific	cloud	providers.	Depending	on	how	specific or	rare	the	required	application	environment	is,	a	cloud	customer could	be	limited	to	a	small	number	of	cloud	providers,	or	even	to	a single	cloud	provider.

D	is	incorrect	because	regulations,	especially	ones	specific	to	certain data,	may	dictate	that	specific	cloud	providers,	or	even	a	single	cloud provider,	must	be	used	in	order	to	maintain	compliance.

### [important] Question # 43 - Within	a	cloud	environment,	which	network	location	would	be	the	LEAST effective	for	a	cloud	customer	to	expect	the	implementation	of	security controls?     
A.	Border	perimeter     
B.	DMZ    
C.	Between	VLANs    
D.	Between	the	data	and	application	zones    
Answer: A.	

In	a	traditional	data	center,	the	border	perimeter	of	the	network	is	a common	place	for	security	devices	and	controls	to	be	implemented,	to stop	traffic	of	certain	types	or	from	certain	origins	from	even	getting to	the	IT	systems	hosted	within	it.	However,	in	a	cloud	environment, especially	with	multitenancy,	the	ability	to	place	anything	at	a	network perimeter	will	likely	be	completely	impossible,	and	even	if	it	is possible,	it	will	be	extremely	limited.

B	is	incorrect	because	a	DMZ	can	still	be	implemented	within	logical network	segmentations	and	virtual	network	devices	in	a	cloud environment.

C	is	incorrect	because	VLAN	segmentation	is	available	and	heavily used	to	logically	separate	network	within	a	cloud	environment. Between	VLANs	would	be	an	effective	location	for	security	controls or	devices.

D	is	incorrect	because	logical	network	zones	can	be	created	within	a cloud	environment	and	would	be	a	very	common	and	strategic	place for	security	controls	or	devices	to	be	implemented.

### Question # 44 - Your	IT	security	director	has	asked	you	to	evaluate	a	cloud	provider	to determine	whether	its	security	practices	match	with	current	organizational policy	in	regard	to	data	sanitation	processes.	Compared	to	your	traditional data	center,	which	of	the	following	options	is	unlikely	to	be	available	with a	cloud	provider?      
A.	Degaussing     
B.	Cryptographic	erasure    
C.	Overwriting    
D.	Zeroing   
Answer: A.	

**Degaussing	is	the	process	of	physically	altering	or	removing	the magnetic	nature	of	storage	hardware,	and	as	such	would	not	be available	within	a	cloud	environment**.	
**This	is	due	to	resource	pooling and	multitenancy,	as	well	as	the	dynamic	nature	of	a	cloud,	where	data can	be	moved	and	stored	in	different	places	constantly**.

B	is	incorrect	because	cryptographic	erasure	involves	the	destruction of	the	keys	used	to	encrypt	the	data,	and	it’s	available	on	any	type	of
system.	It	is	a	very	commonly	used	method	within	cloud environments	for	secure	deletion	of	data.

C	is	incorrect	because	overwriting	involves	writing	over	the	sectors where	the	data	was	written	and	stored.	Although	this	is	trickier	in	a cloud	environment	based	on	the	dynamic	nature	of	data,	overwriting may	be	available	in	situations	where	physical	destruction	of	media would	not	be.

D	is	incorrect	for	the	same	reasons	as	overwriting,	as	zeroing	is	the same	process	but	involves	writing	null	values	to	data	sectors.

### [important] Question # 45 - Which	of	the	following	types	of	threats	is	often	made	possible	via	social engineering	tactics?     
A.	Data	loss    
B.	System	vulnerabilities    
C.	Advanced	persistent	threats     
D.	Insufficient	due	diligence    
Answer: C.	

**Advanced	persistent	threats	occur	when	an	attacker	is	able	to	gain access	to	a	system	and	reside	there	for	a	long	period	of	time	without being	detected.	This	is	usually	done	to	snoop	on	traffic	or	collect information	over	time.	Often	it	is	accomplished	through	social engineering	tactics	to	gain	access	to	valid	and	real	accounts	so	that access	can	be	performed	without	detection**.

A	is	incorrect	because	data	loss	refers	to	an	organization	losing	access to	data	or	the	data	becoming	corrupted,	without	appropriate	backups or	means	of	access.	This	typically	occurs	due	to	hardware	or	system failure	or	due	to	the	destruction	or	corruption	of	encryption	keys.

B	is	incorrect	because	system	vulnerabilities	can	occur	based	on misconfigurations	or	poor	patching	practices;	they	do	not	involve	the actions	of	a	malicious	actor.

D	is	incorrect	because	insufficient	due	diligence	occurs	when	an organization	has	not	properly	planned	a	system	deployment	or migration,	and	therefore	has	left	itself	vulnerable	to	security	threats.

### [important] Question # 46 - If	you	are	bidding	on	contracts	with	the	US	federal	government,	which security	framework	will	you	need	to	be	knowledgeable	of	or	familiar with?      
A.	PCI	DSS     
B.	NIST	SP	800-53    
C.	SOC	2    
D.	ISO/IEC	27001    
Answer: B.	    

The	NIST	SP	800-53	publication	governs	the	requirements	for	the security	of	US	government	systems,	with	the	exception	of	national security	systems.	Anyone	bidding	on	such	contracts	will	need	to	be very	familiar	with	its	requirements	because	they	are	very	specific	in how	hardware	configurations	must	be	done	and	will	be	crucial	for	any contract	proposal.

A	is	incorrect	because	PCI	DSS	applies	only	to	credit	card	payment systems	and	interactions	across	the	networks	and	systems	of	the	major credit	card	companies.	It	does	not	apply	to	government	systems.

C	is	incorrect	because	SOC	Type	2	reports	pertain	to	financial reporting	and	the	security	controls	used	within	them.	They	do	not apply	to	US	government	systems.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	ISO/IEC	27001	security	certification	and framework	is	a	general	security	program	and	does	not	apply	to	US government	systems.

### Question # 47 - Which	of	the	following	cloud	concepts	encapsulates	the	security	concerns related	to	bring	your	own	device	(BYOD)	that	a	cloud	security professional	must	always	be	cognizant	of?    
A.	Portability     
B.	Broad	network	access     
C.	On-demand	self-service    
D.	Interoperability    
Answer: B.	

Broad	network	access	is	a	key	concept	of	cloud	computing,	where services	and	applications	are	accessible	across	the	public	Internet	and through	a	variety	of	clients	and	devices.	This	particularly	applies	to BYOD	situations	and	the	large	number	of	clients	and	configurations that	may	interact	with	cloud	services	and	data.

A	is	incorrect	because	portability	refers	being	able	to	easily	move services	or	applications	between	different	cloud	providers	and	does not	relate	to	issues	involving	BYOD.

C	is	incorrect	because	on-demand	self-service	pertains	to	a	cloud customer	being	able	to	provision	and	allocate	resources	from	a	portal, without	needing	to	interact	with	cloud	provider	staff.	It	does	not pertain	to	BYOD.

D	is	incorrect	because	interoperability	refers	to	being	able	to	reuse components	or	services	for	other	purposes	and	does	not	pertain	to
BYOD.

### Question # 48 - Which	of	the	following	is	NOT	considered	a	building	block	technology for	cloud	computing?     
A.	CPU    
B.	Memory    
C.	Storage   
D.	Servers   
Answer: D.	

Servers	are	not	a	key	building	block	technology	of	a	cloud environment,	because	the	focus	is	on	computing	resources,	not	the number	of	actual	servers	being	used.

A	is	incorrect	because	CPU	is	a	major	building	block	technology	of cloud	computing	and	is	one	of	the	major	billable	items.

B	is	incorrect	because	memory	is	a	major	building	block	technology	of cloud	computing	and	is	one	of	the	major	billable	items.

C	is	incorrect	because	storage	is	a	major	building	block	technology	of cloud	computing	and	is	one	of	the	major	billable	items.
