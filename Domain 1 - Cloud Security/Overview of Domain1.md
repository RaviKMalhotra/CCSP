# Domain 1 in CCSP

# ☁️ CCSP Domain 1: Cloud Concepts, Architecture, and Design — 25 Key Knowledge Points
1. 🔹 NIST Cloud Characteristics: On-demand, broad access, pooling, elasticity, metering.
2. 🛠️ Service Models: IaaS (infra), PaaS (platform), SaaS (apps) — each shifts security.
3. 🌐 Deployment Models: Public, Private, Hybrid, Community — each with distinct risk.
4. 🧱 Virtualization: Powered by hypervisors (Type 1 & 2) for resource abstraction.
5. 📦 Containers: Lightweight OS-level virtualization, faster than VMs.
6. 🧩 Cloud-native Design: Modular, stateless, loosely coupled systems.
7. 🧬 Microservices: Enhance scalability but increase API exposure.
8. ⚙️ Serverless: No infra management, but limited visibility.
9. 🤝 Shared Responsibility: Know what security you own vs. the provider.
10. 👥 Multi-tenancy: Isolate tenant data to prevent leakage.
11. 🛡️ CASB: Enforces cloud usage policies and monitors data flows.
12. 🚪 Zero Trust: Assume breach — verify every access attempt.
13. 🔐 IAM & Federation: Control identity via SAML, OAuth, OIDC.
14. 📡 SDN: Software-driven, dynamic, and programmable networking.
15. 🔒 Encryption: Apply to data at rest, in transit, and in use (if possible).
16. 🔑 Key Management: Prefer customer-controlled encryption keys.
17. 🎫 Tokenization: Substitute sensitive data with secure tokens.
18. 📜 Compliance: Meet GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, etc.
19. 📊 Cloud Controls Matrix: Cloud-specific control set from CSA.
20. 🌍 Data Sovereignty: Be aware of local laws on data residency.
21. 📃 SLAs: Include clauses for security, audit rights, uptime.
22. 📈 Logging & Monitoring: Centralized, immutable, continuous.
23. ⚠️ Risk Assessment: Mandatory before migration or vendor onboarding.
24. ♻️ HA & DR: Design for redundancy, RTO/RPO, and recovery.
25. 🚪 Cloud Exit Strategy: Plan early to avoid lock-in traps.
