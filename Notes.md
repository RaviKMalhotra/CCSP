## Exploring the Pillars of Information Security

Confidentiality
Confidentiality entails limiting access to data to authorized users and systems. In other words, confidentiality prevents exposure of information to anyone who is not an intended party. The concept of confidentiality is closely related to the security best practice of least privilege, which asserts that access to systems or information should only be granted on a need to know basis.

In order to enforce the principle of least privilege and maintain confidentiality, it‚Äôs important that you classify (or categorize) data by its sensitivity level. You explore data classification in Chapter 5, but for this chapter, keep in mind that it plays a critical role in ensuring confidentiality. You must know what data you own and how sensitive it is before determining how to protect it and who to protect it from.

 üçé:TIP  Privacy is a hot topic that focuses on the confidentiality of personal data.

 Integrity
Integrity involves maintaining the accuracy, validity, and completeness of information and systems. It ensures that data is not tampered with by anyone other than an authorized party for an authorized purpose. A checksum is a value derived from a piece of data that uniquely identifies that data and is used to detect changes that may have been introduced during storage or transmission. Checksums are generated based on cryptographic hashing algorithms and help you validate the integrity of data

Availability
Availability is all about ensuring that authorized users can access required systems and data when and where they need it. Availability is sometimes the forgotten little sibling of the principles mentioned in the two preceding sections, but it has a special place in the cloud given that easy access to data is often a major selling point for cloud services. If your letter gets lost in the mail, then availability is a clear issue ‚Äî the message that was intended for you to read is no longer accessible for you to read.

One of the most common attacks on availability is Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, which is a coordinated attack by multiple compromised machines causing disruption to a system‚Äôs availability. Another common and rapidly growing attack on availability is ransomware, which involves an attacker blocking system or data owners from accessing their own systems and data until a sum of money is paid. Aside from sophisticated cyber-attacks, something as simple as accidentally deleting a file can compromise availability.

 REMEMBER  Availability is a major consideration for cloud systems.
