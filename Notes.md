## Exploring the Pillars of Information Security

### Confidentiality
- > Confidentiality entails limiting access to data to authorized users and systems. In other words, confidentiality prevents exposure of information to anyone
  > who is not an intended party.
  > The concept of confidentiality is closely related to the security best practice of least privilege, which asserts that access to systems or information
  > should only be granted on a need to know basis.

In order to enforce the principle of least privilege and maintain confidentiality, it‚Äôs important that you classify (or categorize) data by its sensitivity level. You explore data classification in Chapter 5, but for this chapter, keep in mind that it plays a critical role in ensuring confidentiality. 
You must know what data you own and how sensitive it is before determining how to protect it and who to protect it from.

 üçé:TIP  Privacy is a hot topic that focuses on the confidentiality of personal data.

### Integrity
Integrity involves maintaining the **accuracy, validity, and completeness** of information and systems. It ensures that data is not tampered with by anyone other than an authorized party for an authorized purpose. A che****cksum is a value derived from a piece of data that uniquely identifies that data and is used to detect changes that may have been introduced during storage or transmission. Checksums are generated based on cryptographic hashing algorithms and help you validate the integrity of data

### Availability
Availability is all about ensuring that authorized users can access required systems and data when and where they need it. Availability has a special place in the cloud given that easy access to data is often a major selling point for cloud services. If your letter gets lost in the mail, then availability is a clear issue ‚Äî the message that was intended for you to read is no longer accessible for you to read.

One of the most common attacks on availability is Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, which is a **coordinated attack** by multiple compromised machines causing disruption to a system‚Äôs availability. Another common and rapidly growing attack on availability is **ransomware**, which involves an attacker blocking system or data owners from accessing their own systems and data **until a sum of money is paid.** Aside from sophisticated cyber-attacks, something as simple as accidentally deleting a file can compromise availability.

 REMEMBER  Availability is a major consideration for cloud systems.

### Security controls

So, you know all about confidentiality, integrity, and availability ‚Äî that‚Äôs great! Now, how do you enforce those concepts in your systems? -- said another
way, security controls protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your systems and data.


TIP  You‚Äôll often see ‚Äúsecurity controls‚Äù referenced as just ‚Äúcontrols.‚Äù
Security controls can be categorized in a couple of ways: by their type and by their function.

- Types of security control include
 - Technical controls use technology (shocking, I know!) to protect information systems and data. Things like firewalls, data loss prevention (DLP) systems, and
   encryption fall under this category.
 - Physical controls involve the use of physical measures to protect an organization‚Äôs assets. This can include things like doors, gates, surveillance cameras,
   and physical disposal of sensitive information (including things like shredding and degaussing).
 - Administrative controls include the set of policies, procedures, guidelines, and practices that govern the protection of systems and data. This can be
   anything from incident response plans (see later in this chapter) to security awareness training.

- Functions of security controls include
 - **Preventative controls** keep negative security events from **happening**. This includes things like security awareness training, locked doors, and
   encryption.
 - Detective controls **identify** negative security events when they do happen. Examples of detective controls include log monitoring and video surveillance.
 - Corrective controls fix or reduce damages associated with a negative security event and may include measures to prevent the same negative event from happening
   again. Backups and system recovery features are the most common examples of corrective controls.
 
## Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks ‚Ä¶ Oh My!

Threats, vulnerabilities, and risks are **interrelated** terms describing things that may compromise the pillars of information security for a given system or an asset (the thing you‚Äôre protecting).

**The field of risk management deals with identifying threats and vulnerabilities and quantifying and addressing the risk associated with them**. 
Being able to recognize threats, vulnerabilities, and risks is a critical skill for information security professionals. 
It‚Äôs important that you‚Äôre able to identify the things that may cause your systems and data harm in order to better plan, design, and implement protections against them.

### Threats
**A threat is anything capable of intentionally or accidentally compromising an asset‚Äôs security**. Some examples of common threats include
 - **Natural disasters:** Earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and fires can cause physical damage to critical infrastructure, leading to loss of connectivity, power
   outages, or even complete destruction of systems.
 - **Malware:** Malicious software such as viruses, worms, and ransomware can infect systems, steal data, or disrupt normal business operations.
 - **Phishing attacks:** Deceptive emails, messages, or websites designed to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card
   numbers, or personal data.
 - **Denial of service (DOS) attacks:** Deliberate attempts to overload a network, server, or website with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate
   users.
Though only a few examples, the preceding short list shows how threats can come in all shapes and sizes, and how they can be natural or manmade, malicious or accidental.

### Vulnerabilities

A vulnerability is a weakness or gap existing **within a system**; it‚Äôs something that, if not taken care of, may be exploited in order to compromise an asset‚Äôs confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

Examples of vulnerabilities include
 - Unpatched software: Failure to install updates or patches for operating systems, applications, or firmware, leaving security vulnerabilities open to
   exploitation.
 - Lack of environmental protection: Missing or faulty fire suppression systems or other physical protections, leaving infrastructure vulnerable to natural
   disasters and other environmental threats.
- Insecure passwords: The use of commonly used or otherwise insecure passwords, making it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts or
  systems.
- Untrained employees: Lack of security awareness training for employees and system users, leaving them susceptible to phishing attacks.

‚≠ê **Threats are pretty harmless without an associated vulnerability, and vice versa.** 
A good fire detection and suppression system gives your data center a fighting chance, just like (you hope) thorough security awareness training for your organization‚Äôs employees will neutralize the threat of an employee clicking on a link in a phishing email.

### Risks

**Risk is the intersection of threat and vulnerability** that **defines the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited** (by a threat actor) **and the impact should that exploit occur**. 

In other words, risk is used to define the potential for damage or loss of an asset. Some examples of risks include
 - A fire wipes out your data center, making service unavailable for five days.
 - A hacker steals half of your customer‚Äôs credit card numbers, causing significant reputational damage to your company.
 - An attacker gains root privilege through a phishing email and steals your agency‚Äôs Top Secret defense intelligence.

 **REMEMBER  Risk = Threat x Vulnerability.** 
 **This simple equation is the cornerstone of risk management.** 
 
 
## Understand Identity and Access Management

So much of information security requires you to first have a strong understanding of who your users are and then controlling their actions based on their identity. 
Think about it this way: The principle of confidentiality is pretty hard to enforce if you don‚Äôt first understand who does and doesn‚Äôt qualify as an authorized user, right?

IAM consists of **four** key **elements**: **identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability**.

- Identification is the act of establishing who (or what) someone (or something) is. In computing, identification is the process by which you associate an entity (i.e., a system or user) with a unique identity or name, such as a username or email address.
- Authentication takes identification a step further and validates a user‚Äôs identity. During authentication, you answer the question ‚ÄúAre you who you say you are?‚Äù before authorizing access to a system. Passwords are the most obvious and common forms of authentication, but authenticators (things used to verify identity) can vary. Authenticators generally fit into one of three factors (or methods):
  1. Something you know: Passwords and PINs (Personal Identification Numbers) fall into this category.
  2. Something you have: Security tokens and smart cards are examples of this factor.
  3. Something you are: Examples of this factor include fingerprints, iris scans, voice analysis, and other biometric methods.

REMEMBER  Due to the imperfect nature of any one of the preceding factors, many organizations require Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) or Multifactor Authentication (MFA). MFA has become standard practice for enforcing stronger validation of a user‚Äôs identity. Because passwords can be hacked and security tokens can be stolen, **the idea here is to require more than one form of authentication to reduce the risk of granting access to someone impersonating someone else**.

Once you verify a user‚Äôs identity, you can determine what access to grant them. Authorization is the process of granting access to a user based on their authenticated identity and the policies you‚Äôve set for them. You can control access to systems and data in many ways, but that topic is largely outside the scope of this book.

The final major element in IAM is accountability, **which involves assigning and holding an entity responsible for their actions within an information system**. **Accountability requires establishing unique user identities, enforcing strong authentication, and maintaining thorough logs to track user actions.**

## Deciphering Cryptography

Cryptography is the science of encrypting and decrypting information **to protect its confidentiality and/or integrity**.

### Encryption and decryption
Encryption is the process of using an algorithm (or cipher) to convert plaintext (or the original information) into ciphertext. The ciphertext is unreadable unless it goes through the reverse process, known as decryption, which then allows an authorized party to convert the ciphertext back to its original form **using the appropriate encryption key(s)**. 

An encryption key is a piece of information that allows the holder to encrypt and/or decrypt data.

### Types of encryption
Encryption can either be **symmetric-key** or **asymmetric-key**.

**Symmetric-key encryption** (sometimes referred to as **<ins>secret-key encryption</ins>**) uses the same key (called a secret key) for both encryption and decryption (see Figure 2-2). Using a single key means the party encrypting the information must give that key to the recipient before they can decrypt the information. **<ins>The secret key is typically sent to the intended recipient as a message separate from the ciphertext</ins>**. Symmetric-key encryption is **simple, fast, and relatively cheap**.

 WARNING  A notable drawback of symmetric-key encryption is it requires a secure channel for the initial key exchange between the encrypting party and the recipient. If your secret key is compromised, the encrypted information is as good posted on a billboard.

 **Asymmetric-key encryption (more commonly known as <ins>public-key encryption<ins>)** **operates by using two keys** ‚Äî one **public** and one **private**. The public key, as you might guess, is made publicly available for anyone to encrypt messages. The private key remains a secret of the owner and is required to decrypt messages that come from anyone else (see Figure 2-3). Although public-key encryption is typically slower than its counterpart, **it removes the need to secretly distribute keys and also has some very important uses** (see the next section).

Lastly, in cloud environments, there are different ways that asymmetric keys are generated and even managed. Each has their own benefits and drawbacks. This is covered in Chapter 5.

### Common uses of encryption
Encryption plays an important part in protecting information systems, and its applications are wide ranging. This section discusses some of the most common uses of encryption.

#### Data protection
Arguably the most widely used application of encryption **is to protect the confidentiality of data**. You‚Äôll typically see encryption used for data protection for both data-at-rest (things like files on a hard drive or in a database) and data-in-motion (communication over a network, for example). Both symmetric-key and asymmetric-key encryption are commonly used in data protection applications.

#### Authentication and authorization
Usernames and passwords are often sent to some remote system for authentication and authorization. Encryption is commonly used to protect these sensitive credentials **from eavesdroppers on the network who would intercept the credentials in transit and utilize them to impersonate an authorized user**. **Authentication is a standard use case for public-key encryption**.

#### Network security
**Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the standard technology** used **to encrypt traffic over a network**, and **it creates an encrypted link ensuring that all traffic between two points remains private**. TLS has replaced its longstanding predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), as the de facto standard and **is used widely when privacy and data integrity need to be maintained between two systems**. you need to know that **TLS connections use a combination of symmetric- and asymmetric-key encryption**.

**(HTTPS) is TLS over HTTP** and is the **gold standard for protecting web communications**. HTTPS is incredibly important for banking and other websites where users send and receive sensitive information and is now commonly used as a standard practice. Keep an eye on your browser‚Äôs address bar for https:// to ensure your session is encrypted.

#### Digital signatures
- Much like your handwritten signature is used to verify your identity, a digital signature is a piece of information that asserts or proves the identity of a user.
- **Digital signatures operate on a public-key scheme** and **require a sender to use their private key to electronically sign a message**. Recipients can then use the sender‚Äôs public key to verify their identity. In addition to helping to identify users, **digital signatures support the principle of nonrepudiation**, which is the information security concept that **ensures that a party cannot deny the integrity or authenticity of a digital communication or transaction**. **Nonrepudiation provides assurance that the communication or transaction took place and that the parties involved cannot later deny their involvement.**

#### Virtual private networks (VPNs)
A virtual private network **(VPN) encrypts communication between the two networks**, over the Internet, to create a secure tunnel for communication. You commonly see VPNs used for people who telework by connecting to their organization‚Äôs network from home. Similar to the network security example in the earlier section, **VPNs use a mix of symmetric-key and asymmetric-key encryption**.

#### Crypto-shredding
Standard data deletion involves overwriting data with a series of zeroes, ones, or both. This process is both slow and not completely effective at ensuring bits and pieces of data aren‚Äôt left behind. **A better process, known as crypto-shredding**, **involves encrypting data and then destroying the keys. With no key left behind to decrypt the data, it‚Äôs effectively considered deleted.**

 TIP: If you guessed that symmetric-key encryption is best for crypto-shredding, you‚Äôd be correct! In addition to being simpler, faster, and cheaper, there‚Äôs only one key to delete!

## Grasping Physical Security

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an IT gal/guy. Why should I care about physical security?‚Äù I‚Äôm glad you asked! While most information security discussions focus on using technical controls to protect the data that resides on machines, the protection of physical assets is just as important.

An uncontrolled fire wiping out your data center may not compromise your data‚Äôs confidentiality or integrity, but what about availability? If it impacts one or more of the three pillars of information security, then you, as a security professional, definitely care about it. (For more on this topic, see the section ‚ÄúExploring the Pillars of Information Security,‚Äù earlier in this chapter.)

 REMEMBER  Information security professionals are concerned with anything that impacts the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data or systems. **Don‚Äôt ignore legitimate risks that are present outside of the computer hardware and software.**

In addition to the environmental considerations that come with physical security, keep in mind that you can spend all your time throwing sophisticated technical protections at your systems, but it means nothing if an attacker can simply pick the lock to your data center and walk out with a server! You can find out more about secure physical design in Chapter 11.


## Realizing the Importance of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

You can‚Äôt always stop bad things from happening. The unfortunate reality is some factors will always be outside of your control ‚Äî and when bad things do happen, business continuity and disaster recovery are paramount.

Business continuity (BC) refers to the policies, procedures, and tools you put in place to ensure critical business functions continue during and after a disaster or crisis. The goal of business continuity is to allow essential personnel the ability to access important systems and data until the crisis is resolved. REMEMBER  When you think of disasters and crises, you‚Äôre not only concerned with malicious cyberattacks, but also accidental disruptions, natural disasters, and major system failures.

Disaster recovery (DR) is a subset of business continuity focusing on (you guessed it!) recovering your IT systems that are lost or damaged during a disaster.

In other words, DR is the part of BC focused on restoring full operation of and access to hardware, software, and data as quickly as possible after a disaster. 

Unlike business continuity ‚Äî whose focus is on making a business operational ‚Äî disaster recovery focuses on activities like recovering off-site backups, for example.

 WARNING  Though business continuity and disaster recovery **are closely related, they‚Äôre not the same**. Business continuity broadly focuses on the procedures and systems you have in place to keep a business up and running during and after a disaster. Disaster recovery more narrowly focuses on getting your systems and data back after a crisis hits. The terms are often misused, so make note of the distinction.

You need to be aware of a couple important related metrics:
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** -- is the amount of **time** **within** which business processes **must** be **restored** in order to avoid significant consequences associated with the disaster. In other words, RTO answers the question ‚ÄúHow much time can pass before an outage or disruption has unacceptably affected my business?‚Äù

- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** -- **is the maximum amount of data loss that‚Äôs tolerable to your organization**. It answers the question ‚ÄúHow much data can I lose before my business is unacceptably impacted by a disaster?‚Äù
  - **RPO plays an important role in determining frequency of backups**.

Business continuity and disaster recovery are typically big selling points of cloud computing. The cloud‚Äôs robust infrastructure and redundancy features contribute to increased reliability and resilience, making cloud computing a central part of many organization‚Äôs business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
As a cloud security professional, there are a couple things you should keep in mind regarding business continuity and disaster recovery:

You should ensure that the cloud infrastructure and applications being used have appropriate security measures in place to protect systems and data during both normal operations and disaster scenarios. This includes ensuring encryption, access controls, and other mechanisms remain in place during a disaster.

 You should maintain integrity and availability throughout the disaster recovery process with regular backups, testing, and validation procedures to verify that the backups remain reliable and can be restored successfully, when needed.

 WARNING  Cloud providers commonly advertise their uptime and other availability metrics, but cloud infrastructures and applications are not immune from availability risks. You should conduct regular audits and compliance checks of your cloud services to ensure that their disaster recovery and business continuity plans align with industry regulations and your organization‚Äôs own requirements.

## Understanding Logging and Monitoring

Logging and monitoring are separate, but related, practices that your organization uses to help **detect, escalate, and respond to security events.**
Logging is the process of **recording and storing the key actions**, **activities, and events** that occur within an information system. 
Logging involves capturing important information and storing it in files (or logs) for future reference and analysis.

Examples of key log types include
1. System logs that capture events related to the operating system, such as startups and shutdowns, logins and logouts, system errors and warnings.
2. Security logs that capture things like failed login attempts, changes to access permissions, intrusion attempts, and other suspicious activities that may
   indicate a security incident.
3. Network logs that capture information about network traffic, such as connection information, source and destination IP addresses, and traffic volumes.
4. Database logs that capture changes made to a database, including access, modifications, and queries.
TIP  The log types that you should be aware of depends on your particular environment and use cases. The list here is only a starting point.

**Logging is great and all, but logs serve little purpose if they are not actively monitored.** 

Just like a bank might have security personnel who actively monitor the surveillance systems, monitoring, in the context of information security, involves continuously observing and analyzing your information systems. **By monitoring your systems, you can detect and respond to security events in a timely manner**.

Monitoring activities include: 
  vulnerability scanning, 
  intrusion detection (through the use of intrusion detection systems, or IDS), 
  threat intelligence analysis, and 
  log analysis.

TECHNICAL STUFF  The amount of log data in even a small organization can quickly become overwhelming and impossible to analyze manually. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a category of tools used to collect, centralize, and analyze large volumes of log data from all over your environment. A SIEM tool can help automatically correlate security events and logs from various sources and enable your organization to conduct real-time threat detection and incident response.

## Implementing Incident Handling


It would be great if you could just do your security magic, and nothing bad would ever happen. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt fix every vulnerability or stop every threat ‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs important that you‚Äôre prepared to handle whatever comes your way. The field of incident handling deals with preparing for, addressing, and recovering from security incidents.

I want to define some important terms up front. NIST SP 800-61 defines the following:

 An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network.

 Adverse events are events with negative consequences.

 A computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.

 TIP  While the focus in this section is specifically on computer security incidents, keep in mind that these principles apply to power failures, natural disasters, and so on.

Though every incident starts as an event (or multiple events), every event is not necessarily an incident. To take the distinction even further, not every event is even considered adverse or negative. Some examples of events include

 A website visitor downloads a file.

 A user enters an incorrect password.

 An administrator is granted root access to a router.

 A firewall rejects a connection attempt.

 A server crashes.

Of the preceding events, only the last one is inherently adverse ‚Äî and without further information, you can‚Äôt call any of them incidents. The following list includes some examples of incidents:

 A hacker encrypts all your sensitive data and demands a ransom for the keys (i.e., a ransomware attack).

 A user inside your organization steals your customers‚Äô credit card data.

 An administrator at your company is tricked into clicking on a link inside a phishing email, resulting in a backdoor connection for an attacker.

 Your HR system is taken offline by a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

 WARNING  Make sure you don‚Äôt use the terms event and incident interchangeably ‚Äî they‚Äôre not the same. I have heard IT professionals refer to simple events and/or alerts as incidents, and that‚Äôs a great way to sound alarms that don‚Äôt need to be sounded!

Incident handling starts well before an incident even occurs and ends even after things are back to normal. The Incident Response (IR) lifecycle (shown in Figure 2-4) describes the steps you take before, during, and after an incident. The key components of the IR lifecycle are

 Preparation

 Detection

 Containment

 Eradication

 Recovery

 Post-Mortem

Figure 2-4: The Incident Response (IR) lifecycle.
A flow diagram depicts the incident response lifecycle. It illustrates the following: Preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-mortem.
I cover the preceding concepts in the remaining sections.

Preparing for incidents
You can easily overlook preparation as part of the incident response process, but it‚Äôs a critical step for the rapid response to and recovery from incidents. This phase of incident handling includes things like

 Developing an incident response plan. Your incident response plan identifies procedures to follow when an incident occurs, as well as roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders.

 Periodically testing your incident response plan. Determine your plan‚Äôs effectiveness by conducting table-top exercises and incident simulations.

 Implementing preventative measures to keep the number of incidents as low as possible. This process includes finding vulnerabilities in your systems, conducting threat assessments, and applying a layered approach to security controls (things like network security, host-based security, and so on) to minimize risk.

 Setting up incident analysis equipment. This process can include forensic workstations, backup media, and evidence-gathering accessories (cameras, notebooks and pens, and storage bags/bins to preserve crucial evidence and maintain chain of custody).

Detecting incidents
During this phase, you acknowledge that an incident has indeed occurred, and you feverishly put your IR Plan into action. This phase is all about gathering as much information as possible and analyzing it to gain insights into the origin and impact of the incident. Some examples of activities during this phase are

 Conducting log analysis and seeking unusual behavior. A good Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool can help aggregate different log sources and provide more intelligent data for your analysis. You‚Äôre looking for the smoking gun, or at least a trail of breadcrumbs, that can alert you to how the attack took place.

 Identifying the impact of the incident. Which systems were impacted? What data was impacted? How many customers were impacted?

 Notifying the appropriate individuals. Your IR Plan should detail who to contact for specific types of incidents. During this phase, you‚Äôll need to enact your communications plan to alert proper teams and stakeholders.

 Documenting the findings. The situation will likely be frantic, so organization is critical. You want to keep detailed notes of your findings, actions taken, chain of custody, and other relevant information. This activity helps with your post-mortem reporting later on and also helps you keep track of important details that can assist in tracing the attack back to its origin. In addition, many incidents require reporting to law enforcement, regulators, or other external parties. Thorough notes and a strong chain of custody help support any investigations that may arise.

 TIP  Depending on various factors (the nature of the incident, your industry, or any contractual obligations), you may be responsible for notifying customers, law enforcement, regulators, or even US-CERT (part of Department of Homeland Security). Make sure that you keep a comprehensive list of parties to notify in case of a breach.

Containing incidents
The last thing you want to deal with during an incident is an even bigger incident. Containment is extremely important to stop the bleeding and prevent further damage. It also allows you to use your incident response resources more efficiently and avoid exhausting your analysis and remediation capacity. Some common containment activities include:

 Disabling Internet connectivity for affected systems

 Isolating/quarantining malware-infected systems from the rest of your network

 Reviewing and/or changing potentially compromised passwords

 Capturing forensic images and memory dumps from impacted systems

Eradicating incidents
By the time you reach this phase, your primary mission is to remove the threat from your systems. Eradication involves eliminating any components of the incident that remain. Depending on the number of impacted hosts, this phase can be fairly short or last for quite some time. Here are some key activities during this phase:

 Securely removing all traces of malware

 Disabling or re-creating impacted user and system accounts

 Identifying and patching all vulnerabilities (starting with the ones that led to the breach!)

 Restoring known good backups

 Wiping or rebuilding critically damaged systems

Recovering from incidents
The objective of the Recovery phase is to bring impacted systems back into your operational environment and fully resume business as usual. Depending on your organization‚Äôs IR Plan, this phase may be closely aligned or share steps with the Eradication phase. It can take several months to fully recover from a large-scale compromise, so you need to have both short-term and long-term recovery objectives that align with your organization‚Äôs needs. Some common recovery activities include:

 Confirming vulnerabilities have been patched and fully remediated

 Validating systems are functioning normally

 Restoring systems to normal operations (for example, reconnecting Internet access, restoring connection to your production network, and so on)

 Closely monitoring systems for any remaining signs of undesirable activity

Conducting a post-mortem
After your systems are back up and running and the worst is over, you need to focus your attention on the lessons learned from the incident. The primary objective of the Post-Mortem phase is to document the lessons and implement the changes required to prevent a similar type of incident from happening in the future. All members of the Incident Response Team (and supporting personnel) should meet to discuss what worked, what didn‚Äôt work, and what needs to change within the organization moving forward. Here are some questions to consider during post-mortem discovery and documentation:

 What vulnerability (technical or otherwise) did this breach exploit?

 What could have been done differently to prevent this incident or decrease its impact on your organization?

 How can you respond more effectively during future incidents?

 What policies need to be updated, and with what content?

 How should you train your employees differently?

 What security controls need to be modified or implemented?

 Do you have proper funding to ensure that you are prepared to handle future breaches?

 TIP  For a more in-depth review of handling security incidents, refer to NIST‚Äôs Computer Security Incident Handling Guide (SP 800-61).


 ## Utilizing Defense-in-Depth
One final security concept to explore is defense-in-depth, or layered security. These two terms describe the same idea of applying multiple, distinct layers of security technologies and strategies for greater overall protection. The thought behind this concept is that each layer has its own strengths and weaknesses, which you‚Äôd like to complement one another. A weakness in one layer can be compensated by the strengths in other layers. By applying two or more of the control mechanisms discussed in this chapter (access control, cryptography, and physical security), you can implement defense-in-depth and gain greater overall protection. (I cover additional security controls that support defense-in-depth throughout the remainder of this book.)

Of course, this approach isn‚Äôt foolproof ‚Äî vulnerabilities will still exist. However, a well-executed defense-in-depth approach makes it much harder for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in your system, and much easier for you to detect an incident sooner rather than later. You explore the concept of defense-in-depth as it relates to the cloud throughout the rest of this book.

## Understanding Cloud Computing Concepts

### Defining cloud computing terms

**According to NIST**, ‚ÄúCloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of **five essential characteristics**, **three service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS)**, and **four deployment models (public, private, community, and hybrid)**.‚Äù

The following list is **based on ISO/IEC 17788**, ‚ÄúCloud Computing ‚Äî Overview and Vocabulary‚Äù and defines some important terms used in the cloud computing industry. 
- **Cloud application**: An application that is accessed via the Internet rather than installed and accessed locally.
- **Cloud data portability**: The ability to easily move data from one cloud provider to another.
- **Cloud deployment model**: The way in which cloud services are made available through specific configurations that control the sharing of cloud resources
  with cloud users. The cloud deployment models are public, private, community, and hybrid.
- **Cloud resources:** Compute, storage, and networking capabilities that a cloud provider shares with a cloud user.
  - These resources include the physical equipment located in the cloud provider‚Äôs data centers
  - as well as virtual resources like operating systems and applications.
- **Cloud service:** Capabilities made available to a cloud user by a cloud provider through a published interface (a management console or command line, for
  example).
- **Cloud service category:** A collection of cloud services that share a common set of features or qualities.
  - Cloud service categories are labelled XaaS (where the X can be Anything as a Service).

- **Cloud service customer data:** Any data objects **under the control of the cloud service customer** and that were input to the cloud service by the cloud
  customer or generated by the cloud service on behalf of the cloud customer.
- **Cloud service derived data:** Any data objects **under the control of the cloud service provider** and that were derived by interaction of the cloud customer
  with the cloud service. Derived data may include access logs, utilization information, and other forms of metadata (or data about data).
- **Cloud service provider data:** Any data objects related to the operation of the cloud service and that are fully under the control of the cloud service
  provider. Provider data may include cloud service operational data, information generated by the cloud service provider to provide services, and similar data
  not owned or related to any specific cloud customer.
TIP: The topic of data ownership in the cloud can be a contentious one, and has many legal and compliance implications. It‚Äôs important that cloud providers share clear terms as to what data they own and what the customer owns, as this has an effect on who is responsible for securing what.

- **Community cloud:** Cloud deployment model where cloud services are provided **to a group of cloud service customers** with **similar requirements**.
  - It is common for at least one member of the community to control the cloud resources for the group.

- **Data portability:** The ability to easily move data from one system to another, without needing to re-enter the data.
- **Hybrid cloud:** Cloud deployment model that uses a combination of **at least two** **different cloud deployment models** (public, private, or community).
  - **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):** Cloud service category **that provides infrastructure capabilities to the cloud service customer**.
  - **Measured service:** Delivery of cloud services in such a way that its usage can be **monitored, accurately reported, and precisely billed.**
  - **Multitenancy:** Allocation of cloud resources such that multiple tenants and their data are inaccessible from other tenants who share those resources.
  - **On-demand self-service:** A characteristic of cloud that allows a cloud service customer to provision cloud resources and capabilities with little or no
    interaction with the cloud service provider.
  - **Platform as a service (PaaS):** Cloud service category that **provides platform capabilities to the cloud service customer**.
  - **Private cloud:** Cloud deployment model where cloud **services are provided to a single cloud service customer** who controls their own cloud resources.
  - **Public cloud:** Cloud deployment model where cloud resources are controlled by the cloud service provider and **cloud services are made available to any
    cloud service customer**.
  - **Resource pooling:** Aggregation of a cloud service provider‚Äôs resources to provide cloud service to one or more cloud service customers.
  - **Reversibility: Capability for a cloud service customer to retrieve their cloud service customer data and for the cloud service provider to delete this data
    after a specified period or upon request.**

- **Software as a service (SaaS):** Cloud service category that provides software/application capabilities to the cloud service customer.
- **Tenant:** One or more cloud service users sharing access to a set of cloud resources.

Identifying cloud computing roles and responsibilities
When you (or your customers) move data into the cloud, questions like ‚ÄúWho does what?‚Äù may arise. It‚Äôs important that you become familiar with the common roles in cloud computing environments and understand how the various roles work together to keep cloud data secure:

 Cloud auditor: A cloud service partner who is responsible for conducting an audit of the use of cloud services. An audit may be for general security hygiene, but is often for legal or compliance purposes.

 Cloud service broker: A cloud service partner who negotiates relationships between cloud service providers and cloud service customers.

 Cloud service customer: A person or group that is in a business relationship to provision and use cloud services from a cloud service provider.

 Cloud service partner: A person or group that supports the provision, use, or other activities of the cloud service provider, the cloud service customer, or both.

 Cloud service provider (CSP): An entity making cloud services available for use. I refer to cloud service provider as the CSP in this book.

 Cloud service user: A person or entity (which may be a device, for example) that uses cloud services on behalf of the cloud service customer.

Recognizing key cloud computing characteristics
Five characteristics must be present for a service or offering to be considered cloud:

 On-demand self-service

 Broad network access

 Resource pooling

 Rapid elasticity

 Measured service

Looking at these five essential cloud characteristics, you can see some major themes: convenience, efficiency, and transparency, among others. While cloud has evolved to present a strong case for being secure and cutting-edge, keep in mind that the heart of cloud computing is really all about making resources easy to access, manage, and monitor.

 TECHNICAL STUFF  Although the features described are the five key cloud computing characteristics, a sixth characteristic is worth mentioning: multitenancy. Multitenancy is a feature of most clouds that involves having multiple customers sharing physical hardware. Whereas traditional data centers rely on cages and physically separate servers and network devices to segregate customers, cloud environments rely on logical technologies (like encryption, virtualization, segmentation, and so on) to keep one customer‚Äôs data virtually separated from others. While this is very standard in cloud computing, I explain an exception when I discuss the private cloud deployment model in the ‚ÄúCloud deployment models‚Äù section.

If the five key characteristics are not present in a service or offering, then it is not true cloud computing. Some of these features are defined in the previous sections, but I cover them all in depth in the following sections.

#### On-demand self-service
By design, cloud service providers allow customers to procure and provision cloud resources by anyone who wants or needs them. 
On-demand self-service means that a customer can request, set up, and use cloud services in an automated fashion and without interacting with another human. 
On-demand self-service **allows full cloud usage without approval from your manager, legal team, or finance department**.

The upside to on-demand self-service is the **tremendous ease of procurement**. 
Cloud computing is designed to be easy to get started with; if you can pay for it, you can use it. 
Though self-service is helpful for productivity, security teams should be aware of the risks that come with it and implement policies and procedures to help govern the use of cloud services.

 TECHNICAL STUFF **Shadow IT refers to the use of unsanctioned or unauthorized technology (such as cloud services) within an IT environment, which may lead to unauthorized sharing of information with unapproved third parties**. 
**Shadow IT is one of the key risks related to on-demand self-service in cloud computing and poses significant security risks to your organization‚Äôs data governance and compliance efforts.**

#### Broad network access
Cloud resources should be accessible to any authorized cloud user with an Internet connection. 
The principle behind this characteristic is that **cloud computing should make resources and data ubiquitous** and **easily accessed when and where** they‚Äôre required.

Mature cloud offerings make accessing their resources device-agnostic, allowing cloud users the ability to connect to their cloud services from a variety of endpoint devices that include laptops, desktops, tablets, and even smartphones. 
From a security standpoint, this ability gives customers deploying cloud applications some additional considerations, as cloud computing extends their data to a variety of devices, that may not be within the enterprise‚Äôs control. For this reason, many companies need to examine their mobile device management policies when moving to or operating in the cloud.

 WARNING Bring your own device (BYOD) has become increasingly common and means that companies are allowing employees to connect their own smartphones, tablets, and laptops to corporate systems. BYOD has the benefit of enabling broad access to cloud systems from many devices, but adds concerns regarding device management and secure access methods. Fortunately, cloud computing mitigates some risk of BYOD because it encourages users to store their data in cloud storage rather than on their devices. Additionally, cloud computing can also extend security capabilities (like device checks and monitoring) onto your BYOD devices. Even still, be mindful of your company‚Äôs BYOD policies and consider how cloud systems might impact them.

### Resource pooling
One of the most critical concepts in cloud computing, 
resource pooling occurs when a **CSP groups (or pools) its cloud resources for shared use between multiple cloud customers**. 
What resource pooling allows the CSP to do is scale resources up and down, on a per-customer basis, as each customer‚Äôs resource needs increase or decrease. 
**CSPs can have many thousands of servers, networking devices, and other resources available; pooling allows them to efficiently manage those resources between customers, with minimal waste.**

 TIP  Some organizations prefer or require maintaining segregation between their data and other organizations‚Äô data, which goes against the concept of resource pooling. **Private clouds and some community clouds address this concern with data segregation or isolation needs.**

Resource pooling works closely with rapid elasticity to provide cloud customers a dynamic set of compute, storage, and network resources that are allocated based on each customer‚Äôs needs.

Rapid elasticity
At the core of cloud computing, rapid elasticity allows a cloud customer to quickly obtain additional cloud resources as the user‚Äôs needs require. Think of a retail website during the Black Friday or Cyber Monday shopping frenzy. Rapid elasticity allows that website to seamlessly accommodate a sudden spike in traffic, without the cloud customer‚Äôs intervention, by automatically scaling and provisioning (referred to as auto-scaling and auto-provisioning) resource based on load.

 TIP  It‚Äôs not uncommon for many businesses to have peak-hours or peak-seasons, during which their resource utilization may drastically increase. Outside of these peaks, many businesses can see their resource demands plummet for long periods of time. Rapid elasticity and resource pooling work together to give cloud customers as much compute, storage, and networking power as needed, and nothing more. This capability is important because cloud also leverages a pay-as-you-use model.

Measured service
Cloud computing makes it exceedingly easy for cloud customers to monitor, measure, control, and report on their resource usage. Measured service works in a similar manner to how you might have a measured (or metered) use for your water or electric bill. Similar to these home utilities, CSPs charge customers only for the resources that they use. As such, providing measured services that allows full transparency between a CSP and cloud customer is paramount.

 TIP  Measured service allows your organization to continuously monitor resource utilization in your cloud environment and can help you detect unusual activity (such as Shadow IT or suspiciously high usage volumes resulting from certain compromises). Measured service provides detailed usage logs that assist with security audits and incident investigations.

Building block technologies
Many technologies at the heart of cloud computing architectures are very familiar if you‚Äôve worked with traditional IT hardware and software. Any cloud computing environment, at the most fundamental level, consists of compute (CPU), memory (RAM), storage, networking, virtualization, and orchestration technologies. The customer will have greater or lesser responsibility over these building block technologies, depending on the cloud service category. The following sections explore some of the key building block technologies that exist in cloud environments.

Storage
Cloud storage technologies include object storage (ideal for unstructured data like documents and images) and block storage (ideal for high-performance use cases like virtual machines and databases).

Modern cloud providers offer a wide range of database storage services that support relational databases (such as MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (such as DynamoDB, MongoDB, and Cassandra).

Networking
Key cloud networking technologies include virtual networks, firewalls, load balancers, VPNs, and content delivery networks (CDNs). These networking technologies enable secure and efficient communication in the cloud, and they support several of the key cloud computing characteristics mentioned in the previous section.

Virtualization
Virtualization is a central concept in cloud computing involving the creation of virtual instances that simulate the behavior of physical hardware, including servers, storage devices, and networking equipment. Virtualization abstracts the underlying hardware and allows multiple virtual computing environments to run on a single physical machine.

 REMEMBER  Virtual machines (VMs) are the most easily identifiable form of virtualization, but you should know that storage, networking, compute, and memory resources are all virtualized in a cloud environment.

#### Orchestration
Orchestration, in cloud computing, refers to the **coordination** and management of cloud resources and services. 
Orchestration involves **creating and executing workflows** to provision, deploy, scale, and manage cloud infrastructure and applications.
Orchestration tools help streamline the management of complex cloud environments, enabling efficient resource allocation and ensuring consistent deployment and operations.

TECHNICAL STUFF  **AWS CloudFormation**, **Azure Automation**, **Puppet Bolt**, and **Terraform** are a **few popular cloud orchestration tools**, but there are many others.

TIP **Cloud automation is a subset of cloud orchestration** that involves programming repetitive tasks, such as spinning up and configuring virtual machines. Cloud automation helps you achieve repetitive tasks with minimal human intervention, while cloud orchestration involves coordinating and managing a collection of automated tasks.
