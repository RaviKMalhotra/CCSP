B.	Vendor lock- in     
C.	API contention     
D.	Code escrow    

### Question # 105 - Rick’s company spreads its data across multiple cloud vendors to help ensure that a data loss event or disaster at a single provider doesn’t cause the organization to lose the data. What technique is Rick’s company using?

B.	Data custodian      
C.	Data processor     
D.	Data steward    

### Question # 108 - What makes vendor risk assessment difficult for open source software?      
A. There is no vendor for many open source packages.         
B.	Open source software cannot undergo static code review.               
C.	Open source software vendors do not offer software support contracts.                
D.	Risk information about historical issues is not available.        

### Question # 109 - The law enforcement officer that Henry is working with on a digital forensics effort has asked Henry for a forensic copy of the hard drive for a cloud- hosted desktop as a service system. What should Henry explain to the officer about the differences between cloud- hosted and physical systems?
A.	The forensic copy process will take far longer than normal.     
B.	There is not a physical disk that Henry can access, and a snapshot is the closest equivalent to a forensic copy that he can provide.    
C.	The forensic copy cannot be verified because the disk will change during the process.     
D. Cloud providers do not allow forensic copies of systems in their environments, and only logs will be available.         

### Question # 110 - ITIL v4 identifies four information management subprocesses related to information security management. What ITIL v4 subprocess includes audits?     
A.	Design of security controls

### Chapter 8: Practice Test 2

1.	C. HA, or high availability, mode uses a heartbeat to detect when systems fail. If the heartbeat stops, the virtual machines from that node are restarted on other hosts.

2.	A. Will knows that containers should package a single application per container. Installs should be configured to meet the needs of the application, and default tools should be removed if not needed. Tagging is critical to allow easy control of containers.

3.	B. ISO/IEC 27017 is a security standard that was specifically designed for cloud service  providers. ISO/IEC:20000:1 and PCI DSS are broader standards, and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation is not cloud-specific, either.

4.	A. Since Helen operates an e- commerce site, she is likely to accept credit cards and will need to ensure PCI compliance— a standard required by contract, not by regulation. FedRAMP is a U.S. federal program that focuses on security assessment, monitoring, and other elements related to cloud services. COBIT is a framework that defines practices for the management of IT, much like ITIL.

5.	D. Tools like Amazon’s Patch Manager use patch baselines to determine which patches will be installed or not installed and when they will be installed and can also scan to determine patch status. This fits both Ilya’s need for flexibility and the organization’s preference for buy versus build type tools.

6.	C. Yasmine is conducting nonfunctional testing. This can be somewhat confusing, and it can help to remember that functional testing focuses on the business requirements of the software, not its performance or customer expectations of experience. There isn’t enough information to call this black  box (zero knowledge) testing or white  box (full knowledge) testing.

7.	B. Encrypting logs using customer- managed keys is a best practice to ensure logs are not accessible to third parties. Adam should make sure that his organization controls and manages their keys securely. Allowing the vendor to control the keys means that third parties, including law enforcement or attackers who breach the provider’s security, could gain access to his organization’s logs, and not encrypting logs means they are not protected at rest.

8.	C. SMS delivered codes are considered the least secure because of attacks against SMS, including SIM- swapping and cloning attacks as well as Voice over IP telephony exploits. Hardware- and software- based code generation are considered more secure and thus more desirable.

9.	C. Email and web pages both have structural elements but are not strictly defined and can contain unstructured data. This means that they are examples of semi- structured data.

10.	B. Geofencing allows organizations to designate specific locations to allow or deny operations from. This will allow Felix to set the organization’s facilities as acceptable access locations while denying access from other locations. Zero trust focuses on continuous authorization and authentication, traffic inspection looks at traffic to identify unwanted or unexpected traffic, and network security groups work much like firewalls to allow or deny traffic based on rules.

11.	A. Valerie knows that a region- wide outage could result in a need to operate in another region until services are restored. While this can be a significant undertaking, it may be necessary in a true disaster scenario. While she could look at another cloud provider, the amount of new work required to move from one provider to another is significant. Simply choosing another availability zone or deploying more resources in the same zone or region will not meet her needs because they would all be impacted if the region was down.

12.	A. Casey knows that she won’t have access to hardware- level monitoring for her new environment. That means that CPU and disk utilization are both things she will still be able to monitor but that fan speeds, system temperatures, and system voltages will not be something she is responsible for or able to access.

13.	A. In PaaS environments, customers control the applications they build and the data in the environment. Everything else is the responsibility of the platform vendor.

14.	C. Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems use batteries or other mechanisms to provide power during brownouts when power sags. A generator takes time to come up to speed and doesn’t handle short disruptions easily. Purchasing power from two different providers may 
help, but if brownouts are still occurring, the UPS is a better solution. Power distribution units (PDUs) are used to get power to servers and systems and to control and monitor it, but they don’t have an impact on brownouts or power losses.

15.	A. Infrastructure as a service solutions allow customers to build and manage their own infrastructure using resources provided by the service provider. PaaS provides customers with a platform to build their applications on, and SaaS provides software as a service. CaaS sometimes stands for containers as a service but is not a broadly adopted cloud term.

16.	D. Susan’s organization is using anonymization to remove identifiable information from the customer data. Randomization would randomize the data, removing its linkages to other  elements while retaining formatting and content to allow for testing. Data masking removes elements of data from view, often using asterisks or other characters to replace the information. Hashing uses hashes to create data elements that can still be referenced without the original data being accessible.

17.	B. SOC 2 audits cover security controls and Type 1 audits cover a point in time. SOC 1 audits cover financial controls, and Type 2 audits cover a period of time.

18.	D. In an IaaS environment the customer will be responsible for web servers and other services provided. DNS logs, billing records, and API logs are all likely to be under the control of the service provider.

19.	D. ITIL defines an availability manager as the individual responsible for defining, analyzing, planning, measuring, and improving availability of IT services. This key role is the process owner for availability management in ITIL.

20.	C. Wayne’s architects have a specific role defined by his organization. That means that a custom role with appropriate rights is the best option for the cloud architects. Cloud vendor best practices and built- in roles are available as starting points, but organizations typically go beyond those roles as they define their own needs. Finally, MFA isn’t used to map roles.

21.	B. Policies need to be written to work with organizational culture or they are likely to fail. That means writing a policy and expecting culture to change is not a common principle. In fact, it is a terrible idea!

22.	A. Lucca knows that privacy issues are legal issues, not technical issues. Data breaches, system outages, and denial- of- service attacks all target systems and technical infrastructure.

23.	B. Type 2 hypervisors are run on top of an existing operating system. Type 1 hypervisors are installed on bare- metal systems, essentially as their own operating system. Neither requires being run in the cloud, and Type 2 hypervisors can often be run inside of other hypervisor environments, although it may not always work as well as intended.

24.	A. Amazon’s S3 is an example of object storage. Block storage works like a traditional local drive, although the disks are typically virtual, whereas network file storage allows you to connect to a drive across a network. Native storage is not a common cloud storage type.

25.	A. Privacy impact assessments focus on the what, why, and how of personally identifiable information, including legal and policy requirements, risks, and controls. It does not specifically seek to identify the cost of privacy controls or efforts.

26.	A. Including labels in the files in a way that allows them to easily follow the files is the most effective option for Mike. While labels could be modified or removed, normal usage will not result in their loss. Filenames are often changed, a second file can easily be forgotten or removed, and cryptographic wrappers introduce overhead and are also likely to be decrypted and forgotten.

27.	C. Regulations often have a required time frame for notification built into the law. It may set a time period or simply be tagged as requiring a reasonable time frame, but regulations are the most likely to require this. Customers and partners may have contractual requirements for notification rather than being required by law, and law enforcement notification is often at the option of the organization.

28.	C. Modern design principles call for automation for monitoring whenever possible. The scope and scale of cloud deployments as well as the volume of logs and other monitoring information mean that manual efforts are unlikely to be successful. Instead, manual efforts should be reserved for escalation and oversight whenever possible. Meeting compliance requirements, using layered security, and automating deployment of sensitive tasks are all in Google’s Cloud Architecture Framework’s security principles found at https://cloud .google.com/architecture/framework/security/security- principles.

29.	B. Common phases in waterfall- based SDLCs include Requirements Gathering, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Reverse engineering is not a typical SDLC phase.

30.	B. Michelle should verify that her cloud provider provides a cloud HSM (hardware security module) capability. A cloud HSM will allow her to generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys and other secrets securely in the cloud.

31.	C. In most IaaS environments, computation time is virtualized and allocated based on performance. That performance is billed based on time, but allocation isn’t based on time. Customers may be able to pay for dedicated CPUs or cores; however, this is not the most common model for allocation, and it carries additional expense.

32.	D. Gurvinder should ensure that his organization finds a vendor that will guarantee a service-level agreement (SLA) that meets the organization’s needs. A QSA is a PCI assessment professional, an NDA (nondisclosure agreement) is used to protect sensitive data shared between organizations or individuals, and an MSA (master services agreement) defines how organizations will work together.

33.	C. Confidential computing is a technology that protects data in use, even while being processed thanks to the use of protected CPU enclaves.

34.	A. Susan should deploy an IDS (intrusion detection system). IDS deployments are designed to see traffic and identify issues without stopping it. An IPS is placed in- line to detect and potentially stop attacks. Firewalls and network security groups use rules rather than detection.

35.	D. ISO/IEC 20000- 1 points to service catalog items, including descriptions of the service, service-level definitions and objectives, contact points, support information, dependencies on other services, and security details. It doesn’t include risk ratings— those are typically maintained outside of a service catalog as part of an organization’s risk management discipline.

36.	A. STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

37.	C. Google Workspace is an example of a software as a service environment where Google provides the software and all of the underlying support and infrastructure is run by Google. Brian’s organization simply provides users with access to workspace, unlike a platform as a service model where they would have to develop applications inside of the platform. An infrastructure as a service model would involve running systems and infrastructure, and DaaS frequently means desktop as a service.

38.	B. Software composition analysis is the process of determining what open source components make up a software package. Static testing looks at source code, interactive security testing looks at code for vulnerabilities while it is being interacted with by a human or automated tester, and fuzzing sends unexpected input to software to see where it may fail or respond in unexpected ways.

39.	C. Partnership agreements often have breach notification clauses built into them. Chris should use the breach notification language in their partnership agreement to guide his communications with the partner organization. That organization may choose to share additional information but is unlikely to detail customers, systems, partners, or services unless required to by the agreement.

40.	C. Residual risk is the risk that remains after controls are implemented. Inherent risk is the original level of risk that exists before controls. Opportunity risk and controlled risk were both made up for this question.

41.	B. Virtualization is the key building block technology that allows multiple systems to run on the same hardware. Selling fractions of systems allows cloud providers to efficiently use their resources as part of the cloud business model.

42.	A. Using TLS for all communications can help protect data in motion. AES is often used for data at rest. Using UDP or requiring a three- way handshake like TCP does not add security for data in transit.

43.	D. Rick should look for proper indemnification language that ensures that the vendors take responsibility for problems or issues that they cause. An operational level agreement (OLA) is an internal agreement on service levels, a SLA is a service-level agreement, and service-level management won’t meet Rick’s needs either.

44.	C. An SOC 3 report is intended for general audiences, and Type 2 reports provide information about controls over time. SOC 1 covers financial practices, SOC 2 looks at security controls but is intended for internal audiences, and SOC 4 doesn’t exist.

45.	B. FIPS 140- 2 is a U.S. government encryption standard, and vendors often ensure that their hardware and software is FIPS 140- 2-certified. EBCDIC is an 8- bit encoding scheme used on IBM mainframes that was a rival to ASCII for character encoding, and the remaining answers were made up.

46.	A. DevOps in a continuous integration/continuous delivery environment emphasizes automation of security processes to allow consistent, speedy delivery. Major releases, testing in production instead of before release, and static code review are all likely to slow down a CI/ CD pipeline.

47.	B. Michelle knows that eDiscovery can be more complex in a cloud environment and that her organization may need to invest extra time and effort in preparing for eDiscovery in the cloud if they anticipate lawsuits to be an ongoing issue or event. While cybersecurity risks, data security, and copyright infringement could be involved, eDiscovery is the primary risk listed here.

48.	C. In ephemeral environments IP addresses are frequently reused, and usernames aren’t directly associated with systems in most cases. That means that tags are the most important item to capture to ensure that each system can be logged appropriately.

49.	A. Justin knows that tagging early in the data lifecycle can help data loss prevention (DLP) systems by making it easier to detect sensitive data that may be in transit or at risk of being exposed. Data lifecycle management is helpful but not as critical for this specific purpose as DLP. IDS detection can use tags to identify data in motion but can’t stop it, meaning that it will be less effective for stopping data breaches than a DLP. Honeypots are not used to capture tags; they’re focused on acquiring tools and technique information from malicious actors.

50.	A. Cloud identity providers commonly support SAML and OpenID. LDAP is more commonly used for on- site directory purposes. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a Windows remote access protocol, and FedID was made up for this question.

51.	A. SOC 2 Type 2 reports cover security controls and practices over a period of time, while Type 1 reports cover a point in time. Hyun knows that SOC 1 reports cover financial practices and aren’t appropriate for his security needs.

52.	C. Kayla knows that multiple systems with a load balancer can handle availability issues more easily. If a system fails to respond, the load balancer can remove it from the pool and send an alert. She also knows that this can result in better performance and the ability to scale more easily to meet higher demands. Confidentiality, the number of vulnerabilities, and shorter patching windows are not results of this type of design.

53.	C. Rene knows that business continuity focuses on continuing to operate during a disaster. That means that deploying instances to multiple availability zones is a reasonable business continuity choice. Planning for region failure or provider failure and ensuring staff aren’t all in the same location are common disaster recovery practices.

54.	B. OWASP recommends the use of dynamic secrets to limit the blast radius of compromised applications and secrets. A dynamic secret is requested and generated dynamically when an application starts, meaning that attackers who recover secrets from a running application and then use them or attempt to obtain them from source code will not succeed.

55.	A. Jim is likely using ephemeral block storage that is treated like an actual disk would be. Ephemeral storage exists only as long as the instance does. Long- term storage is used for backups and other long- term needs, object storage uses APIs and treats each file as a unique object rather than as traditional files in a filesystem, and container storage is not a type of storage.

56.	B. Lisa knows that packet capture on a shared management backplane is prohibited by cloud providers. She’ll need to use built-i n logging mechanisms and configuration review to understand what occurred in her environment.

57.	D. The process of matching fields in one database to another is called data mapping. Data migration can involve any of a number of processes for moving data, data mining is a term used to describe pulling insights and information from data sets, and data consolidation might involve moving data to a central repository or location.

58.	A. Wayne should look for systems that support AES- 256 encryption at rest as well as customer- provided keys to ensure that his data remains safe while resident on his cloud provider’s infrastructure. MD5 and SHA- 1 are both hashing algorithms, not encryption algorithms, and CRC is a means of validating that data is intact.

59.	C. Sandboxing technologies are very frequently used for testing malicious software. If you’d like to give it a try, Cuckoo Sandbox is an automated malware analysis tool that you can experiment with. Sandboxes are not used to build redundant infrastructure, for rapid application development, or for FIPS testing.

60.	A. Sharing responsibility with a cloud provider can make the registered entity’s job easier— but also increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure, makes the control structure more complex, and makes it harder to ensure confidentiality of encrypted data.

61.	A. Static code analysis, the process of reviewing the source code, is the most likely way for Jason to identify business logic issues. Vulnerability scanning won’t identify business logic issues, and the likelihood of dynamic testing identifying them is much lower than for static inspection. Software composition analysis focuses on identifying open source components in software, not on business logic.

62.	A. Creating a snapshot will preserve both the memory state and the data associated with an instance. Making separate copies of any mounted volumes will support the investigation and capture any data that is not part of the instance itself. Shutting down the instance will lose memory state, and most cloud providers do not provide a forensic response team for customers.

63.	C. Creating and using baselines helps ensure that systems and services meet an organization’s desired configurations as they are deployed. Multifactor authentication and vulnerability scanning are both useful practices, but they don’t help in this scenario. Default settings are one of the most common misconfigurations— using them instead of intentionally choosing settings is a root cause for misconfiguration issues!

64.	B. A statement of work (SOW) describes the work that an organization will perform under the relationship defined by a master service agreement. An SLA is a service-level agreement, an NDA is a nondisclosure agreement, and a SOP is a standard operating procedure. None of these define what an organization will do as part of an MSA.

65.	D. Christina is using federation, where an identity provider authenticates identities it is responsible for while service providers like Christina authorize users who have been authenticated to perform actions and to use rights inside of their service. This could involve client/ server designs, but the question does not define this, and while Christina is acting as a service provider, the relationship itself is a federation relationship. Collaboration is not used to describe this type of identity architecture.

66.	B. Software composition analysis is the process of identifying the open source components and packages that make up a tool or product. Naomi should perform software composition analysis to understand components and packages she may need to update or that could create additional risks in her environment. Static testing— either automatic or manual— would require reviewing source code, which would involve high levels of effort without meeting the high- level goal of understanding the risks of the components as components. IAST (interactive application security testing) is useful for validating running software but does not meet Naomi’s needs.

67.	B. Selah knows that there is multiple common open source licensing, including Apache and BSD licenses, the GNU public license (GPL), and others. Selah needs to understand the licenses that apply to the software she uses, particularly if she wants to distribute any software for commercial use. The cost of licensing, length of license period, and changes in the license are not common concerns for open source software due to the way that open source licenses are normally written.

68.	D. The company is using single sign- on, a technology that allows users to sign on once and then remain signed in while using multiple services and systems. Each system or service may provide its own authorization to logged- in users. Federation relies on an identity provider, which authenticates users who can then use services from service providers; since Eric is operating inside of a single company, and no identity provider is mentioned, this is not federation. MFA (multifactor authentication) is not mentioned, and IAM is the general discipline of identity and access management.

69.	B. ITIL defines three subprocesses for configuration management: configuration identification, configuration control, configuration verification and audit. If you encounter a question like this and aren’t familiar with details of ITIL or other standards, consider which options are least likely to make sense in the scenario.

70.	B. Conducting a gap analysis requires a baseline or configuration standard to validate against. Chuck knows that he’ll need to build a baseline, then test against it. An OLA is an operational-level agreement used for internal service provider metrics services. A disaster recovery and business continuity plan is not typically required for a gap analysis, but not having one would likely be considered a gap, and an ITIL- based CI is useful for documentation but not a requirement here, either.

71.	C. Annie knows that while automated testing is useful, it has limitations and will miss issues that a human can identify. That means that she’ll focus on manual QA testing if she needs more insight into the software. Fuzzing tests software by providing unexpected inputs, which won’t meet Annie’s QA needs, and software composition analysis determines what open source components are part of a software package.

72.	A. In federated environments identity providers will provide browsers or other clients with a token to pass to the service provider that supports the user’s identity assertion. A password or session ID is not passed, and a URL may be passed but without a password.

73.	C. Theresa is describing a recovery point objective, or the amount of data that can be lost after recovery from a disaster. A recovery time objective defines how long systems can be offline. Neither snapshot windows nor snapshot durations are commonly used terms.

74.	D. The rate of risk occurrence per day is unlikely to provide useful context for the risk management program. The number of risks that have been identified and the number of risks that have occurred over a longer period of time can be useful, and the cost of the program itself is an important metric to track.

75.	B. Storage capacity management is most frequently associated with managing costs in IaaS environments. It can also be a concern in both SaaS and PaaS environments, particularly if usage doesn’t match typical customer models. Performance, continuity, and security are not major drivers of capacity tracking tools.

76.	C. Lisa knows that one of the most difficult challenges in many modern organizations is to determine the full scope of the organization’s cloud usage and environment. Even in organizations that have tight controls, additional services are often found when auditors assess actual usage.

77.	A. MFA tokens are hardware devices and aren’t stored in cloud secrets management tools. API keys, passwords, and certificates are all commonly stored in secrets repositories.

78.	B. Gary’s primary threat model with a remote workforce will be laptops and mobile devices. Using a DLP client on those devices will allow monitoring where the data is being used, accessed, and likely shared.

79.	A. Tagging data when it is created ensures that it will be tagged from the beginning of its lifecycle. Additional tags may be added during the Use, Share, and Archive phases if they are needed.

80.	B. Serverless environments are built around microservices meaning that identity and access management (IAM) focuses on very specific and directed rights for each role or service. Serverless allows organizations to ignore patching the underlying infrastructure, ephemeral infrastructure makes it hard for attackers to compromise and retain access to serverless deployments, and serverless relies on instrumentation for visibility.

81.	D. Nick is using tenant partitioning by separating his customers into separate buckets. That means he can design around customers never having access to shared storage space, hopefully increasing the security of his design. This doesn’t aggregate storage— in fact, it separates it. Using multiple buckets isn’t virtualization or containerization, either.

82.	A. Automated testing can frequently identify SQL injection, cross- site scripting, and component issues, but business logic risks are harder to identify without understanding of both business processes and how the code itself works. Katie may need additional review for critical code by humans in the process if she has recurring issues with business logic flaws.

83.	A. Thulani is recording the chain of custody for the forensic artifacts. A chain of custody can be extremely important to prove that data was not tampered with, particularly in legal cases or police investigations.

84.	A. The EU’s GDPR includes a wide range of privacy requirements. U.S. law is far less consistent and does not directly align to EU requirements. This means that Derek knows that the difference in privacy law in different jurisdictions can be a significant compliance challenge.

85.	B. Enabling password complexity requirements has largely been replaced by use of SSH keys and multifactor authentication. Changing the SSH port number and limiting which users can log in are also both common practices.

86.	D. ISO/IEC 22301:2019 defines business continuity management. ISO 27001 is a standard on how to manage information security, ISO 28000 specifies security management systems, and there is no ISO 853- 1.

87.	D. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) operates on UDP port 67 for the server and UDP port 68 for clients.

88.	B. Sara’s usage matches a hybrid cloud environment, where she provides some of the infrastructure and the rest is provided by third- party cloud providers. Private cloud is run by the organization, multicloud involves multiple vendors, and community clouds are created by groups with a common interest or objective that want to operate a cloud.

89.	C. Isabelle knows that cloud providers commonly make APIs accessible for access to their logging and other facilities. She can take advantage of the API access to get the data she needs, but she will need to carefully document the process, queries, and other details to ensure her data is forensically sound.

90.	A. Data in cloud environments should be encrypted at rest and then cryptographically shredded when it is no longer needed to ensure that the data is not recoverable.

91.	A. Infrastructure as code strategies leverage code to design, build, and deploy infrastructure, allowing for quick changes at scale and the ability to redeploy or perform other maintenance easily and quickly. Containerization-b ased strategies focus on containers. While it may rely on code, containerization alone doesn’t meet the description of what Mark is doing. Software as a cloud and dynamic scaling architecture were made up for this question.

92.	D. A dedicated hardware security module (HSM) is the most secure option for organizations that have the money and security requirements to support it. A dedicated HSM provides a hardware that is dedicated to the customer, rather than the shared environment provided by a cloud HSM. A TPM (trusted platform module) is used to store cryptographic keys used for hardware and system boot time security and isn’t used to store and manage general- use secret keys.

93.	A. Ashley is conducting abuse case testing, which focuses on testing software like an attacker. IAST involves instrumenting applications to monitor them while they are running for any security issues. User acceptance testing is done in partnership with users to determine if the software meets their needs and functional requirements, and static testing reviews source code.

94.	A. ISO 27001 defines a broad range of security controls and is a widely accepted international standard. SOC 1 is an audit standard for financial operations, GDPR is a data protection regulation for the EU, and HIPAA is a U.S. law covering healthcare and insurance providers.

95.	B. An ITIL- based change management process typically starts with the creation of the RFC. It is then reviewed, then approved or denied, and then planning and implementation occur as well as an after- deployment review.

96.	D. Gina’s organization is using tokenization. They may choose to use a form of hashing for the tokenization process, but there is not enough information in the question to determine that. Masking would replace some data with alternate characters, avoiding revealing the entire data element. Anonymization seeks to remove any directly identifiable data like names, addresses, or similar information.

97.	B. The requirement to retain data related to a lawsuit, investigation, or for other legal reasons is called a legal hold.

98.	B. When certificates are revoked, they are placed on a certificate revocation list. Users and systems that use the certificate can check the CRL for that certificate authority to determine what certificates have been revoked. Certificates can still encrypt data, messages are not sent out to all users, and the expiration date is not changed for the certificate since it is included in the certificate itself.

99.	A. Data stored in a database is considered structured data. Since there is a defined format, structured data is typically the easiest to perform data discovery on.

100.	D. Since Patricia wants to have a system learn a baseline, then watch for new malicious behaviors while integrating the ability to learn, AI is her best option. AI- based systems can learn from data over time. A SIEM may include AI, but that is not specified here, making AI a better answer. A WAF (web application firewall) and an IDS (intrusion detection system) won’t do what Patricia needs.

101.	B. Kathleen knows that engaging external counsel with appropriate expertise with the laws of the country that her organization is moving into will result in the best answers. OWASP and NIST don’t provide guidance on international law, and reviewing laws internally without expert counsel is typically not as likely to result in appropriate decision-making.

102.	D. Business, legal, and regulatory requirements are all common drivers for data retention policies. Data integrity is important but typically doesn’t drive data retention policies. Instead, data integrity is likely to drive technical implementation requirements that help to ensure data integrity is maintained over the data’s lifecycle.

103.	A. Parker should look for an API gateway that can help to rate limit and control API access by his organization’s customers. API gateways often act as load balancers and firewalls as well, and API engine isn’t a term typically used in this context.

104.	B. Ron should be concerned about vendor lock- in due to the investment his organization has in the specific tools available in his vendor’s environment. While this allows Ron’s team to more fully take advantage of the features of the IaaS environment, it would take significant new investment to move to another cloud vendor since a large amount of the work would need to be redone. Interoperability is a concern when working between two or more clouds or services. Code escrow places source code with a third party in case the developer goes out of business, and API contention is not a commonly used term.

105.	C. Rick’s company is using data dispersion, the concept of storing data in more than one location to reduce the chance of a major loss event. Data cloning is not a commonly used term in this context. Data modeling is used to identify elements of data for efforts like database creation.

106.	A. Using software composition analysis is a key first step when using open source tools, as it allows organizations to understand which components are part of their systems and services. After that, performing relevant updates and keeping track of what components may not be receiving updates is critical. Penetration testing and static code review may be helpful, but they aren’t typical solutions in this scenario.

107.	A. Megan is a data owner. Data custodians are responsible for transport, storage, and implementation of business rules for data. Data processors use data for business efforts, and data stewards are responsible for data governance tasks based on business rules.

108.	A. Many open source packages do not have commercial or paid support or vendors to assess. This makes assessing the risk of open source packages and tools more difficult from a vendor risk perspective. Open source software is actually easier to conduct static code review of than many commercial products since the code is available. Open source software vendors do sell support contracts, and risk information is available via the same sources as other vulnerability information.

109.	B. Henry knows that traditional forensic copy techniques won’t work but that a snapshot will provide the same information that the officer is used to working with. Thus, Henry needs to explain what is possible and how it can be used. The forensic copy process may be faster or slower depending on the cloud systems and process; the forensic copy can be verified, particularly if the system is paused; and cloud providers do allow forensic copies of customer- owned and - managed systems.

110.	D. Audits fall under security review, where security measures and processes are validated and checked for regular testing. Design and incident management doesn’t include this, and security testing ensures that security mechanisms are validated.

111.	C. In IaaS environments, network connectivity is determined by instance type and sizing, and thus how much customers will pay for the capabilities they need. Changing to a more capable instance type is the most common way to do this, although providers may also provide the ability to increase network bandwidth as an independent setting. Changing network interface cards or operating system settings won’t accomplish Diana’s task.

112.	D. The final stage of the cloud secure data lifecycle is to destroy the data.

113.	B. Sarbanes–Oxley has language requiring that fraud is reported, including data breaches, and that reporting must be included in quarterly and annual reports.

114.	D. Agile processes gather information from users, customers, and documentation. Reverse- engineering software to obtain requirements is not a common requirements- gathering process.

115.	B. The OWASP Top 10 provides a regularly updated list of the most common pitfalls and problems with application development and is a commonly used basis for training in many organizations. MITRE’s ATT&CK framework is used to document adversary tactics and techniques, and both the SANS Blue Book and NIST’s CMBD were made up for this question.

116.	C. Cloud service brokers aggregate services, provide integration services, and otherwise help their customers work with cloud service providers. Regulators enforce the law, and cloud stewards were made up for this question.

117.	A. The CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits) rating system provides an industry standard to describe, rank, and track vulnerabilities. None of the other items listed are vulnerability ranking systems.

118.	D. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) would directly impact the organization’s data gathering and handling practices in France. ISO/IEC 27018 and GAPP are both standards that the organization might choose to adopt, and FERPA is a U.S. higher education privacy regulation.

119.	C. Fiona knows that capturing snapshots is the most frequent means of creating backups for guest operating systems. Copying the underlying guest OS disks and using backup clients are both sometimes used, but snapshots of the guest OS from the guest itself is not.

120.	B. Olivia knows that cloud providers typically don’t allow customers to audit them, but that many provide audit artifacts upon request. She should request the audit information she needs and may even find that the provider already makes it available as part of an audit artifact service.

121.	A. ITIL describes release closure as what occurs after verifying that logs and the management system are up-to-date with updated information. Deployment and build happen before this, and documentation is not an ITIL subprocess for releases.

122.	A. Type 1, or bare-metal, hypervisors are used to host most cloud IaaS services. Running Type 2 hypervisors on top of existing operating systems is typically less efficient and adds operational and management overhead. There are only two types of hypervisors, meaning Types 3 and 4 don’t exist.

123.	C. Sean should rent space in an existing Tier 3 datacenter facility. If Sean was operating at a large scale instead of having outgrown a converted closet, building or buying a datacenter might make sense.

124.	C. Customers are typically not allowed into cloud service providers datacenter facilities. This helps to reduce risk of access to customer data due to physical access. Inexpensive power, environmental risks, and redundant design are all common concerns for cloud datacenter design.

125.	B. Maria’s organization is using a masking technique to hide most of the credit card number. Leaving the last four numbers un- masked is a technique intended to allow validation of card numbers. Hashing was the result in a fixed length string of letters and numbers as part of a one- way function. Randomization might be used to mix up real data for a sample data set, and de- identification removes personally identifiable data like addresses, Social Security numbers, or names.
