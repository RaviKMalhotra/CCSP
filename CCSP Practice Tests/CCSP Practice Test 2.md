### Chapter 7: Practice Test 1

1.	C. Tier 1 and 2 datacenters are not required to have sufficient redundant components to remain operational during equipment maintenance. This is a requirement of both Tier 3 and Tier 4 datacenters. Therefore, the lowest acceptable tier would be Tier 3.

2.	B. In an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model, the provider is only responsible for provisioning the devices and computing/storage capacity; the customer is responsible for everything else, including the security of the applications.
All the other answers are incorrect because those individuals/organizations do not accept responsibility for securing cloud- based applications.

3.	C. Software composition analysis (SCA) is designed to identify open source libraries and other dependencies in software used inside of an organization. It often detects dependencies that developers may not have been aware of during software development. Static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and interactive application security testing (IAST) are all techniques used to identify security flaws in code created by developers and may not necessarily detect the use of dependent packages.

4.	C. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) work specifically at watching for anomalous or malicious system activity at the network level and provide alerts and/or reports on such activity. They do not provide any type of blocking activity or remediation by themselves.

5.	A. Hypervisor access should be strictly limited in order to preserve tenant isolation in the multitenant environment. For this reason, customers should never be given direct access to the hypervisor itself. Any configuration changes necessary on a hypervisor should be made by employees of the IaaS provider itself.

6.	A. In the public cloud computing model, the vendor builds a single platform that is shared among many different customers. This is also known as the shared tenancy model.

7.	C. This is the definition of federation. PKI is used to establish trust between parties across an untrusted medium, portability is the characteristic describing the likelihood of being able to move data away from one cloud provider to another, and repudiation is when a party to a transaction can deny having taken part in that transaction.

8.	A. All of these technologies have some capability to assist with this task, but the question is asking about the one that is best suited for this purpose. Data loss prevention (DLP) systems are specifically designed to detect and prevent unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive information. Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) are designed to consistently enforce security policies across cloud providers. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are designed to identify and block malicious activity on the network or on a system. Next- generation firewalls (NGFWs) are designed to block unauthorized network connections.

9.	C. While off-site storage is a cloud service offering, it is not intrinsic to the definition of cloud computing. The core characteristics of cloud computing do include broad network access, metered service, and on- demand self- service.

10.	D. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive.

11.	C. This is a very difficult question because it references some similar ISO standards. We can immediately eliminate ISO 27701 as an option because that standard references privacy controls, rather than the security controls that Tonya is evaluating. The remaining three standards all cover security controls. However, ISO 27017 is specifically focused on cloud provider security controls and would be the standard best suited to Tonya’s needs. ISO 27001 and 27002 are more general- purpose standards covering security controls at any type of organization.

12.	A. Tokenization replaces sensitive data elements with a unique identifier. These records may be reidentified using a lookup table in a database. If this lookup table was compromised, then the data is not secure. If the lookup table remains secure, the privacy of the data remains intact. Tokenization does not use cryptographic keys, which are used in encryption. Tokenization also does not use hash functions, which are used in hashing.

13.	B. Using different vendors for multiple systems of the same type adds resiliency; if one product has an inherent manufacturing flaw, the other should not, if it comes from a different producer. The other suggestions are all good practices for building a datacenter, but they do not offer redundancy or resiliency.

14.	D. EAL4 indicates that a system has been methodically designed, tested, and reviewed. EAL3 indicates that a system has been methodically tested and checked. EAL2 indicates that a system has been structurally tested. EAL1 indicates that a system has been functionally tested.

15.	A. A honeypot consists of a computer, data, or a network site that appears to be part of a network and seems to contain information or a resource of value to attackers but is actually isolated and monitored. Although a honeypot is generally run in a sandbox, they are not the same thing.

16.	D. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the most common way to implement the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which provides encryption between a web server and a client. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) was previously used for this purpose but is now considered outdated and insecure. Internet Protocol Secure (IPsec) is used to create encryption network connections between a remote user and a network or between two networks but is not commonly used for web applications. Domain Name Systems Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is used to provide authenticated name resolution.

17.	B. SOC 2 audits cover the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and are intended for internal audiences only because they contain sensitive information. SOC 2 audits should only be shared with customers under a nondisclosure agreement. SOC 3 audits cover the same controls as SOC 2 audits but are intended for a general audience. SOC 1 audits cover only the internal controls related to financial statements and reporting. SOC 4 audits do not exist.

18.	D. Adam might be required by law, regulation, or contract to notify any number of stakeholder groups. Contracts with customers and partners may include notification clauses. Regulators may have jurisdiction over this breach depending on the location and subject matter, and their regulations may require prompt notification of a potential breach.

19.	C. API gateways typically offer features that include rate limiting, access control, and logging. They do not normally perform content filtering. This capability is often performed by web application firewalls (WAFs) that operate in conjunction with an API gateway.

20.	A. The most accurate source of location information is data obtained from the Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS provides precise pinpoint location data. IP addresses may be loosely correlated with physical location, but this data is notoriously inaccurate. MAC addresses are tied to a particular piece of hardware and are not tied to a physical location. User attestation depends on users providing accurate and truthful responses.

21.	A. A hardware security module (HSM) is designed specifically to safely store and manage encryption keys. These devices are considered more secure than storing keys in software since the encryption techniques can be much stronger.

22.	B. In a typical TLS handshake, the client sends the message (called ClientHello) that initiates the negotiation of the session.
All the other options are incorrect.

23.	A. In the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model, the customer is responsible for everything up from the hardware layer.
In platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS), this will be performed by the provider; options B and C are incorrect.
Function as a service (FaaS) is a subcategory of PaaS and, therefore, D is also an incorrect answer.

24.	D. The exposure factor is the percentage of the facility that risk managers expect will be damaged if a risk materializes. It is calculated by dividing the amount of damage by the asset value. In this case, that is $750,000 in damage divided by the $2 million facility value, or 37.5 percent.

25.	C. The annualized rate of occurrence is the number of times each year that risk analysts expect a risk to happen. In this case, the analysts expect fires will occur once every 50 years, or 0.02 times per year.

26.	A. The annualized loss expectancy is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). In this case, the SLE is $750,000, and the ARO is 0.02. Multiplying these numbers together gives you the ALE of $15,000.

27.	B. The most difficult challenge when working with many different cloud providers is working through the eDiscovery procedures offered by each relevant provider. Most providers today provide eDiscovery capabilities and are willing to cooperate with litigation- related requests. The cloud does not change the complexity of identifying relevant records, which is normally done by keyword search, or determining when eDiscovery is necessary, which is normally made by legal counsel.

28.	C. Encryption secures data at rest and in transit. The provisioning capability of IRM systems focuses on providing rights to individuals based on roles and job functions. Tagging and data labeling are used to ensure that data is handled appropriately based on rules.

29.	A. Threat modeling is the idea of identifying specific points of vulnerability and then implementing countermeasures to protect or thwart those points from successful exploitation. All the other answers are incorrect variants.

30.	B. Situations where humidity is too high may result in the buildup of moisture and corrosion of equipment. If humidity falls too low, it may result in static electricity issues. Humidity issues generally do not contribute to fires or physical access control failures.

31.	D. Data loss prevention systems do use pattern matching, metadata, and content strings to identify the presence of sensitive information.
Tokenization is a technology that replaces sensitive data elements with alternative values that are not sensitive. This action may be taken in response to the presence of sensitive information, but it is not used to detect sensitive information.

32.	A. SHA3 is a hash function that replaces data with values that can be referenced without exposing the actual data. Anonymization focuses on removing data that can be associated with specific users or individuals, masking uses alternate characters to conceal data, and shuffling switches data around while retaining actual data for testing.

33.	D. SOC 3 reports are intended for public disclosure. SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports are intended only for use within a company or with trusted partners.

34.	B. All management functions should take place on a highly secure, isolated network called the management plane.
The toolset may be available via remote access but is not in any way to be considered public- facing; option A is incorrect.
Resource pooling contradicts the use of dedicated storage areas for each customer; option C is incorrect.
Usually, virtualization management will be a responsibility of the provider because it is a crucial element for all customers; option D is incorrect.

35.	B. With platform as a service (PaaS), the cloud provider will administer both the hardware and the OS, but you will be in charge of managing the applications and data. There is less likelihood of vendor lock- in with PaaS than software as a service (SaaS), because your data will not be put into a proprietary format (option B is preferable to option C).
With infrastructure as a service (IaaS), your company will still retain a great deal of the administrative responsibility, so PaaS is a better option; option B is preferable to A. Security as a service (SECaaS) is a specialized service offering for managed cybersecurity services and would not meet the general- purpose computing needs described in this scenario.

36.	B. While all aspects of cloud computing are necessary to provide a true cloud service, this type of business flexibility is possible because of rapid (close to instant) elasticity, the means to scale your usage up and down as needed.
All the other options are facets of cloud computing but are not as pertinent to the question.

37.	B. Data owners hold overall responsibility for data that they own and are typically responsible for classification decisions. Data custodians are responsible for the data, ensuring access control, proper storage, and other operational controls. Data processors are often third parties who process the data as part of a business process, and data users are end users who use the data for their job.

38.	B. Cross- site scripting attacks execute code on a remote user’s system. SQL injection vulnerabilities allow an attacker to send commands through a web application to the database supporting that application. Cross- site request forgery and server- side request forgery attacks seek to exploit trust relationships by tricking systems into authorizing unauthorized activity.

39.	C. Many security solutions, particularly DLP and similar tools, require a “learning curve” as they become accustomed to new data sets/configurations in order to discriminate between false positives and actual data loss. One week is not enough time to get an accurate determination of the efficacy of these products, and waiting to gather more data over time is a good idea.
The origin of the products probably does not matter in any significant way; options A and B are incorrect.
Hastily migrating out of the current cloud environment (whether to another cloud provider or back on- premises) is reactionary and could prove expensive. Option D is incorrect.

40.	A. While any stakeholder may request information about service outages, customers have the greatest stake in outages and are most likely to demand timely communication about outages and their resolution.

41.	D. The logical design phase is the part of the SDLC in which all functional features of the system chosen for development in analysis are described independently of any computer platform.

42.	D. While it’s likely the participating organizations will be subject to other federal regulations, HIPAA covers electronic patient information, so it will definitely be applicable in this case. FERPA applies to educational institutions, so option A is incorrect.
FMLA dictates how employers give vacation time to employees, so option B is not correct. PCI DSS is a contractual, not regulatory, standard, so option C is incorrect.

43.	D. This is an excellent description of the hybrid model, where the customer owns elements of the infrastructure (the on- premises traditional environment) and the cloud provider owns other elements (the cloud environment used for the temporary additional demand).
All the other options are cloud deployment models but do not suit this particular case.

44.	C. REST calls web resources by using uniform resource identifiers (URIs).
Extensible Markup Language (XML) may be used for REST, but it is not a requirement as it is in Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Option A is incorrect.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a form of XML used in passing identity assertions; option B is incorrect.
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a secure virtual private network (VPN) mechanism, not an element of SOAP. Option D is incorrect.

45.	A. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a set of practices that focus on aligning IT services with business needs.

46.	B. Virtual server instances use block storage to provide disk volumes. These are typically mounted as drives on the server instance. Object and archival storage cannot be mounted as a drive. Ephemeral storage is not preserved when a server is shut down, so it is not appropriate for important long- term data.

47.	C. A master services agreement (MSA) is an umbrella document that governs many different projects conducted by the same service provider. Each one of those projects is then described within a statement of work (SOW). A business partnership agreement (BPA) is used to define the terms of a joint venture between two organizations. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is an informal document describing the relationship between two organizations or business units of the same organization.

48.	C. The fact that many various customers (including some that may be competitive with, or even hostile to, each other) will be utilizing the cloud environment concurrently means that isolating each is of the utmost importance in the cloud environment.
DDoS is an availability threat, not something to do with confidentiality, so isolation does not serve much purpose in reducing it. Option A is incorrect.
Unencrypted message traffic is not the prevailing general reason for the need for isolation; it might be one specific, particular aspect of a confidentiality concern, but option C is preferable to B.
Insider threat is not countered by isolation in the same way that isolation protects against threats due to multitenancy; option C is preferable to D.

49.	A. The identity provider would hold all of the identities and generate a token for known users. The relying party (RP) would be the service provider and would consume the tokens. All other answers are incorrect.

50.	C. All of these options are methods of applying encryption to sensitive data. However, the question asked specifically about stored data and, of the choices listed here, only volume encryption affects stored data, or data at rest. Transport Layer Security (TLS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and IP Security (IPsec) only protect data in transit over a network.

51.	D. Inert gas systems use no water and are unlikely to damage sensitive electronic equipment, even if discharged. Wet pipe, dry pipe, and preaction systems all use water and may damage or destroy electronic equipment if activated or damaged.

52.	A. Portability is the term used to describe the ease with which a customer can move from one cloud provider to another; the higher the portability, the less chance for vendor lock- in. Interoperability describes how systems work together (or don’t); because the question did not mention the use of your own company’s systems, interoperability does not seem to be a major concern in this case. Option B is incorrect.
Resiliency is how well an environment can withstand duress. While this is of obvious importance to all organizations in the cloud, it is usually seen as a defense against availability concerns, while the question has more to do with portability; option A is still preferable to option C.
Nothing in the question suggests a need for the company to retain some form of governance; option D is incorrect.

53.	A. FIPS 140- 2 is a detailed federal government standard for cryptographic modules, including HSMs, and is likely to contain detailed technical requirements. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) may reference the use of HSMs but does not contain detailed technical requirements. ISO 27017 similarly provides a high- level description of cloud provider security controls but does not contain detailed technical requirements. The Common Criteria outline a process for certifying secure information systems but do not contain detailed technical requirements.

54.	B. Audits don’t really provide any perceptible effect on user experience.
All the other options are good reasons for performing audits.

55.	A. As a cloud customer, the organization is not responsible for making up- front infrastructure purchases, which are capital expenditures.
Cloud customers do, however, make continual operational expenditures for IT resources in the form of their payments to cloud providers. Option B is incorrect.
Modern business is driven by data as much as any other input, regardless of sector or industry; this does not change whether the organization operates in the cloud or in the traditional IT environment. Option C is incorrect.
The cloud does not obviate the need to satisfy customers. Option D is incorrect.

56.	D. To be used in a secure manner, certificates must take advantage of a hash function that is not prone to collisions. The MD2, MD4, MD5, and SHA- 1 algorithms all have demonstrated weaknesses and would trigger a vulnerability. The SHA- 256 algorithm is still considered secure.

57.	A. This vulnerability should not prevent users from accessing the site, but it will cause their browsers to display a warning that the site is not secure.

58.	B. This error is a vulnerability in the certificate itself and may only be corrected by requesting a new certificate from the certificate authority (CA) that uses a secure hash algorithm in the certificate signature.

59.	C. RAID uses additional hard drives to protect the server against the failure of a single device. Load balancing and server clustering do add robustness but require the addition of a server. Scheduled backups protect against data loss but do not provide immediate access to data in the event of a hard drive failure.

60.	C. Mean time to repair (MTTR) is the time required to repair a device that has failed or is in need of repair. The term mean indicates the average time as opposed to the actual or past experiences.

61.	B. Static application security testing (SAST) differs from dynamic application security testing (DAST) in that it looks at source code and binaries to see if it can detect problems before the code is loaded into memory and run.

62.	C. Relational databases organize data into tables, which is a highly structured format. Therefore, relational databases should be expected to contain structured data.

63.	A. DNSSEC is basically DNS with added security benefits. These benefits include providing origin authority and data integrity guarantees when queries are answered. DNSSEC also provides authenticated denial of existence when domain names do not exist. DNSSEC does not provide confidentiality, so it does not offer payload encryption.

64.	C. The recipient of a message encrypted using an asymmetric encryption algorithm decrypts that message using their own private key. Therefore, Alice should use her own private key to decrypt the message that Bob encrypted using Alice’s public key. Bob would not use his own private key to encrypt the message because then anyone (not just Alice) would be able to decrypt the message with his public key.

65.	D. In an elevation of privilege attack, the attacker transforms a limited user account into an account with greater privileges, powers, and/or access to the system. Spoofing attacks falsify an identity, while repudiation attacks attempt to deny accountability for an action. Tampering attacks attempt to violate the integrity of information or resources.

66.	C. A Type 2 hypervisor is one in which an operating system is installed onto the hardware with the hypervisor being installed on top of the OS. These types of hypervisors are thought to be more vulnerable to attack since the attack surface is larger, therefore providing more opportunities for intrusions.

67.	C. FedRAMP is a government- wide program that provides for a standardized approach to security assessments, authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud products and services. FedRAMP certification can be quite costly and difficult to achieve but is required if you want to host a U.S. government agency or subcontractor.

68.	D. Senior management is always responsible for determining the risk appetite of any organization, regardless of where and how it operates.
Neither the cloud provider, nor the ISP, nor federal regulators determine the risk appetite of your organization. Options A, B, and C are incorrect.

69.	D. Sending invoices to clients is an act of transferring data and is, therefore, an example of the Share phase of the cloud data lifecycle.

70.	D. Carla should use a digital signature to provide nonrepudiation. Anyone later wishing to verify the integrity and authenticity of the data may validate the digital signature. Digital signatures combine the use of cryptographic hash functions and encryption, but neither of those technologies on their own provides nonrepudiation. Multifactor authentication provides strong access control, but does not provide nonrepudiation.

71.	B. Because you will be creating proprietary software, you will probably be most concerned with how it will function across many platforms, in a virtualized environment, and in an environment that you do not own or operate. Interoperability describes how well a system relates to other systems.
Portability is always a concern for cloud customers, as it is an indication of how likely the customer is to be subject to the risk of vendor lock- in. However, because you are using your own proprietary software and not that of another company, this is not a major issue in this case. Option A is incorrect.
Resiliency is how well an environment can withstand duress. Although this is of obvious importance to all organizations, it is usually seen as a defense against availability concerns; the question has more to do with interoperability, and thus option B is still preferable to option C.
Nothing in the question suggests a need for the company to retain some form of governance; option D is incorrect.

72.	B. Content- based discovery includes two subcategories: string matching and pattern matching. This is an example of pattern matching, where Luis’s tool is looking for data elements that fit a common pattern. There is no indication that Luis is looking at labels or metadata or, in fact, that these elements even exist. Classification- based discovery is not a type of data discovery technique.

73.	B. SAML 2.0 is currently the standard used to pass security assertions across the internet. REST and SOAP are ways of presenting data and executing operations on the internet, and HTML is a way of displaying web pages.

74.	A. The purpose of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is to provide power to systems for a short period of time. They provide immediate backup power from a battery that should be quickly replaced by long- term backup power from a generator or similar source. For this reason, you should only expect the UPS to last for about 10 minutes.

75.	A. Degaussing refers to the practice of using strong magnets for scrambling data on magnetic media such as hard drives and tapes. Although scrubbing generally can scramble data as well as degaussing, it does not use magnets.

76.	A. It is appropriate to set a lifecycle policy that follows the standard use case. This would mean archiving data after 90 days and then deleting data after five years to minimize costs. Gary can handle any litigation holds that arise as exceptions to this standard policy, as litigation holds typically affect only a small portion of data.

77.	B. Gary should take the action required to comply with the litigation hold notice, but he may do so as narrowly as possible to minimize costs. In this case, the data affected is from March 2022, so he should take action to ensure that this data is not deleted. The data may still be archived. He does not need to take any action on data from other time periods unless the litigation hold notice is expanded.

78.	A. The data subject is the person who the personally identifiable information (PII) describes. The entity that collects or creates the PII is the data owner or controller. The entity that uses the data on behalf of the owner/controller is a data processor. Entities that regulate the use of PII are regulators.

79.	D. Sandboxing is often used for testing untested applications or carving out resources that cannot then touch other parts of the same system as part of a security strategy to isolate those operations. Therefore, isolating or cordoning off the compute environment is needed.

80.	A. The CSA CCM will aid you in selecting and implementing appropriate controls for various regulatory frameworks. The CCM does not aid in collecting log files; that is the function of a security information and event management (SIEM), search engine marketing (SEM), or security information management (SIM) tool. The CCM will not help ensure that the baseline is applied to systems; automated configuration tools are available for that purpose (although this answer might be interpreted as desirable; the CCM will help you select appropriate controls for your baseline, but it won’t check to see if those are applied). Contract terms are not enforced by the CCM; the service-level agreement (SLA) should be the mechanism for that task.

81.	A. Both ISO 31000 and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800- 37 are risk management frameworks.
Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) is ISACA’s framework for managing IT and IT controls, largely from a process and governance perspective. Though it includes elements of risk management, NIST 800- 37 is still closer in nature to ISO 31000, so option A is preferable to B.
ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a framework mostly focused on service delivery as opposed to risk management; option C is incorrect.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union law regarding privacy information, not risk management; option D is incorrect.

82.	C. Trusted platform modules (TPMs) are chips inside a computer that perform a variety of security functions, including managing full- disk encryption keys. Hardware security modules (HSMs) are more sophisticated (and expensive) devices used to manage encryption keys across an enterprise. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a system of issuing and maintaining encryption keys for use among many individuals and organizations. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) monitor for and block malicious activity on a system or network.

83.	B. Testing the product in a runtime context is dynamic testing.
Because this is being done in runtime, it is neither code review nor static testing; options A and C are incorrect.
Using a small pool of specified individuals is not truly open source, which would involve releasing the game to the public. Option D is incorrect.

84.	C. The due care principle states that an individual should react in a situation using the same level of care that would be expected from any reasonable person. It is a very broad standard. The due diligence principle is a more specific component of due care that states that an individual assigned a responsibility should exercise due care to complete it accurately and in a timely manner.

85.	D. Of the answers given, option D is the most important. It is vital that any datacenter facility be close to sound facility resources such as power, water, and connectivity.

86.	C. Archival storage typically has long retrieval times and provides the most inexpensive method for storing data. Other storage classes, including block storage, general- purpose object storage, and raw storage, have higher pricing.

87.	B. There is no indication that any changes were made to the service or supporting infrastructure, so the change management process would not likely be impacted. This situation is an incident and should be handled using the incident management process. It is also an availability failure and possibly a violation of a service-level agreement, so the availability management and service-level management processes are also involved.

88.	A. These are technical controls, automated systems that perform security functions.
An argument could be made that there is an administrative component to these controls as well: the firewall rules, the DLP data discovery strategy, etc.— these are expressed in the form of a list or set of criteria, which might be viewed as an administrative control. However, the system itself (which is what the question asked) is still a technical control. Option A is preferable to option B.
Because these devices/systems do not deter physical intrusion but rather logical intrusion, they are not considered physical controls.
“Competing” is not a control type.

89.	C. The protection of intellectual property is a greater concern during a divestiture, where a subsidiary is being spun off into a separate organization, than an acquisition, where one firm has purchased another. Acquisition concerns include consolidating security functions and policies as well as integrating security tools.

90.	B. Vendor lockout occurs when a cloud provider ceases operations and customers are unable to access their data. Vendor lock- in is the result of a lack of portability, for any number of reasons. Masking redacts certain digits or text from sensitive information to make it less sensitive. Tokenization replaces sensitive data elements with placeholder values.

91.	C. Data classification decisions are typically made based on the sensitivity, criticality, and/or jurisdictions involved. These decisions are not typically made based directly on the age of the data. If age does factor into a decision, it is because the age would lower the sensitivity and/ or criticality of the data.

92.	C. Default credentials are the bane of security everywhere. This is definitely the correct answer because it should not be part of the baseline build.
All the other options are actual baselining functions.

93.	D. When data is subject to a litigation hold, data custodians must suspend any mechanisms that may delete or modify affected data. For this reason, Richard should set the retention period to indefinite for as long as the litigation hold remains in place.

94.	C. Virtualization toolsets help map storage; support improved networking, video output, sound, or input capabilities; or otherwise improve the experience and functionality for virtualized operating systems. They are commonly used in virtualized environments and provide a secure connection between the technologies.

95.	A. There are two possible techniques for revoking a digital certificate: updating the certificate’s status using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and adding the certificate to a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Of these, OCSP provides faster updates and is the preferred method. It is not possible to change the public or private keys associated with an existing digital certificate.

96.	D. This is a community cloud, because various parties own different elements of it for a common purpose. A private cloud would typically be owned by a single entity, hosted at a cloud provider datacenter. A public cloud would be open to anyone and everyone. Hybrid cloud environments mix together elements of public and private cloud computing.

97.	D. Capacity management ensures that IT resources are sufficient to meet current and future business demands. Availability management improves the resiliency of IT services to ensure their ability to meet customer needs. Service-level management ensures that the IT organization is fulfilling its obligations to internal and external customers. Configuration management entails documenting the approved settings for systems and software, which helps establish baselines within the organization.

98.	B. The cloud data lifecycle is: Create, Store, Use, Share, Archive, Destroy.

99.	D. Ephemeral storage is temporary storage associated with a server instance. It will be deleted if the server is terminated, but it will not be deleted if the server is simply stopped or rebooted. Stopping a server allows it to be restarted at a later time, which requires access to the ephemeral storage. Terminating a server completely deletes it and the ephemeral storage.

100.	C. Tokenization is an approved alternative to encryption for complying with Payment Card Industry (PCI) requirements.
Obfuscation and masking don’t really serve the purpose because they obscure data, making it unreadable; storing payment information that is unreadable does not aid in the efficiency of future transactions. Moreover, neither technique meets PCI requirements. Options A and B are incorrect.
Hashing does not serve the purpose because it is a one- way conversion of data; there is no way to retrieve payment information for future transactions once it has been hashed. Option D is incorrect.

101.	B. RAID technology provides fault tolerance for hard drive failures and is an example of a business continuity action. Restoring from backup tapes, relocating to a cold site, and restarting business operations are all disaster recovery actions.

102.	C. GLBA mandates requirements for securing personal account information in the financial and insurance industries; Bob’s company provides financial services, so he will definitely have to comply with GLBA. If Bob’s company is publicly traded, he may have to comply with SOX, but we don’t know enough about Bob’s company from the question to choose that answer. HIPAA is a requirement only for medical providers and their business associates. PCI DSS may apply to Bob’s organization if they process credit card transactions, but PCI DSS is a private regulation and not a law.

103.	A. Interview videos are typically stored as unstructured data. They are commonly simple binary objects maintained on disk. Sales transactions, customer contact information, and website visitor logs are all normally highly formatted data stored in a spreadsheet, database, or structured log file.

104.	D. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is currently used to encrypt and protect U.S. government sensitive and secret data. There are variants, but the most common is 256- bit, which is virtually impossible to break today.

105.	D. Risk acceptance occurs when an organization determines that the costs involved in pursuing other risk management strategies are not justified and they choose not to pursue any action.

106.	B. Linda should choose a warm site. This approach balances cost and recovery time. Cold sites take a very long time to activate, measured in weeks or months. Hot sites activate immediately but are quite expensive. Mutual assistance agreements depend on the support of another organization.

107.	A. Purchasing insurance is a way to transfer risk to another entity. Risk avoidance actions change business processes to eliminate a risk. Risk mitigation activities reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk occurring. Risk acceptance takes no action to control the risk other than acknowledging its presence.

108.	C. A cross- site scripting attack (XSS) occurs when an application receives untrusted data and then sends it to a web browser without proper validation, allowing an attacker to execute scripts in the user’s browser, hijack sessions, or engage in other malicious behavior.

109.	D. FIPS 140- 2 is the federal standard for the accreditation and distinguishing of secure and well- architected cryptographic modules produced by private sector vendors who see to or are in the process of having their solutions and services certified by the U.S. government departments and regulated industries that collect, store, transfer, or share data that is deemed to be sensitive but not classified.
ISO 27036 provides standards for supply chain management. ISO 27050 provides standards for electronic discovery efforts. The Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT) provide a generalized management framework for IT organizations. None of these documents provide a standard for accrediting cryptographic technologies.

110.	C. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and the Extensible Markup Language (XML) are data formats commonly used with semi- structured data, and MongoDB is a database platform commonly used to store JSON- formatted data. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to access relational databases, which contain highly structured data.

111.	B. A SYN flood is where a TCP connection attempt is made and then cut short just prior to completion, thereby leaving a server waiting for a response. If enough of these connection attempts are made, a “flood” occurs, causing the end unit to consume resources to the point that either services and/or the system itself become unavailable for use. The other options have no connection with a flood of any kind.

112.	C. Chain of custody refers to the process of never letting a piece of evidence out of one’s control without proper signatory transfers indicating the who, what, when, and where it occurs so that the courts can ensure that the evidence could not have been tampered with.

113.	C. Chris should conduct his investigation, but there is a pressing business need to keep the website online. The most reasonable course of action would be to take a snapshot of the affected system and use the snapshot for the investigation, maintaining website operations. There is no reason to believe that the web server or application has any vulnerability, so the use of the site for fraudulent activity doesn’t merit shutting down the site.

114.	A. In TLS, the parties will establish a shared secret, or symmetric key, for the duration of the session. All the other options are incorrect because they are not the form of cryptography used for the session key in a TLS session.

115.	D. Secure sanitization is not included in all (or even many) SDLC models.
The other options are typical SDLC steps.

116.	B. The hypervisor is responsible for coordinating access to physical hardware and enforcing isolation between different virtual machines running on the same physical platform.

117.	A. Because the cloud provider owns and operates the cloud datacenter, the provider will craft and promulgate the governance that determines the control selection and usage. This is another risk the cloud customer must consider when migrating into the cloud; the customer’s governance will no longer have direct precedence over the environment where the customer’s data is located.
Both the cloud customer and the regulator(s) may have specific control mandates that might require the customer to deploy additional security controls (at the customer side, within the data, as agents on the user devices or on the provider side, or in application programming interfaces [APIs] as allowed by the service model or contract), so options B and C are also partially true, but A is a better answer as it is more general.
Option D is untrue because the end user does not determine which controls are selected for the cloud datacenter and how they are deployed. That is the responsibility of the cloud provider.

118.	D. SAFEcode provides a global forum for software developers and technology leaders to come together in an effort to improve application security practices. ATASM, PASTA, and DREAD are all threat modeling frameworks.

119.	B. The residual risk is the level of risk that remains after controls have been applied to mitigate risks. Inherent risk is the original risk that existed prior to the controls. Control risk is new risk introduced by the addition of controls to the environment. Mitigated risk is the risk that has been addressed by existing controls.

120.	D. The order of volatility specifies the likelihood that data will be erased imminently. Investigators should collect the most volatile evidence first. The contents of RAM are highly volatile and are the most volatile data source listed here. This is followed by files stored on a server hard drive, files stored in archival storage, and the contents of firmware.

121.	C. The Agile Manifesto specifically advocates for getting sample systems into the hands of the users as soon as possible in order to ensure that development is meeting customer needs. The Manifesto refutes all other elements of programming that slow down this effort, including an excessive focus on documentation and planning.

122.	B. A platform as a service (PaaS) environment will likely provide the best option for testing the game; the provider will offer various OS platforms for the game to run on, giving your company the opportunity to reach as many customers (using various platforms) as possible, raising your potential for market penetration. Although infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is not a terrible option and would give your team additional control of the entire test, it would also require the team to duplicate many different platforms and OSs, requiring a much greater level of effort and additional expertise at what would likely be a much greater cost. 

Option B is preferable to option A.

A software as a service (SaaS) model will not allow your team to install and run the game; option C is incorrect.
Function as a service (FaaS) is a subcategory of PaaS computing, but it does not allow for the running of full applications, such as video games. Instead, it is designed for executing small portions of code, making option D incorrect.

123.	B. SOAP uses an XML- based approach to interoperability, allowing systems to interact more easily.
SOAP is not particularly lightweight; in fact, it is kind of cumbersome. Option A is not true.
SOAP is not especially more secure than DCOM or CORBA; option C is incorrect. SOAP is newer than the other technologies; however, that is not the reason it is preferable in a web context. Option B is still preferable to D.

124.	A. Business impact analysis (BIA) determines the impact on a business from the loss of support or availability of any resource. It also establishes the escalation of that loss over time, identifies the minimum resources needed to recover, and prioritizes the recovery of processes and supporting systems.

125.	A. A private cloud is an infrastructure provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization consisting of multiple customers (e.g., business units) and may be owned, managed, or operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of both and may exist on- or off- premises.
