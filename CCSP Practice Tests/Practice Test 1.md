### Comprehensive	Answers	and	Explanations


### Questions # 1 - Which	cloud	service	category	is	most	associated	with	auto-scalingofferings	for	a	cloud	customer?    
A.	IaaS    
B.	PaaS    
C.	SaaS   
D.	DaaS    
Answer: B.	  

Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS)	is	most	associated	with	auto-scaling, as	PaaS	offers	a	fully	configured	and	deployable	hosting	environment, where	the	cloud	customer’s	application	code	and	data	are	the additional	components	needed	to	make	everything	fully	functional.	It allows	for	programmatic	and	automatic	expansion	of	an	environment to	meet	current	need	with	minimal	additional	configuration	required from	the	cloud	customer,	as	opposed	to	IaaS.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Although	Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS) allows	for	auto-scaling	as	well,	PaaS	entails	the	least	overhead	for	the cloud	customer	and	enjoys	the	greatest	ease	of	automatic	expansion. Software	as	a	Service	(SaaS)	and	Desktop	as	a	Service	(DaaS)	are environments	maintained	by	the	cloud	provider,	and	although	they	do offer	auto-scaling	in	many	instances,	they	are	not	applications deployed	specific	to	the	cloud	customer.

 ### Questions # 2 - Which	of	the	following	is	NOT	considered	one	of	the	core	building-block technologies	of	cloud	computing	and	services	offered	by	cloud	providers?    
A.	CPU    
B.	Memory     
C.	Operating	systems    
D.	Storage     
Answer: C.	

Operating	systems	are	not	one	of	the	key	components	of	the	cloud computing	resources	and	services	offered	by	a	cloud	provider. Depending	on	the	cloud	service	category,	operating	systems	may	not even	be	a	factor	at	all,	such	as	with	IaaS,	where	they	are	the	sole responsibility	of	the	cloud	customer,	and	they	are	certainly	not	a universal	factor	across	all	cloud	service	categories.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	CPU,	memory,	and	storage	are	they	key building	blocks	of	cloud	computing	that	are	universal	across	all	cloud service	categories.	They	form	the	basis	for	measured	services	and resource	pooling.

 ### Questions # 3 - If	an	organization	desires	to	utilize	multiple	cloud	providers	for	the purposes	of	redundancy	and	disaster	recovery	strategies,	which	cloud deployment	model	would	be	the	most	appropriate?     
A.	Hybrid    
B.	Private     
C.	Public     
D.	Community     
Answer: A.	    

A	hybrid	cloud	solution	utilizes	multiple	different	cloud deployment	models	to	meet	an	organization’s	needs.	It	allows	an organization	to	use	different	providers	and	types	of	services,	but	in	a way	where	the	systems	are	compatible	and	interchangeable.

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Public,	private,	and	community	cloud deployment	models	are	single	systems	that	do	not	enjoy	the	diversity of	a	hybrid	cloud	across	multiple	providers	or	deployment	models.

 ### Questions # 4 - Which	of	the	following	strategies	to	ensure	data	deletion	andunrecoverability	is	the	most	likely	to	be	available	within	a	cloud environment?    
A.	Degaussing    
B.	Cryptographic	erasure    
C.	Overwriting     
D.	Shredding     
Answer: B.	   

Cryptographic	erasure	involves	the	purposeful	destruction	of encryption	keys	that	were	used	to	protect	data.	Destroying	the	keys ensures	that	the	encryption	cannot	be	undone	or	recovered,	or	at	least not	within	any	time	frame	that	would	be	useful	or	practical.	Because this	process	is	entirely	software	based,	it	would	be	available	in	any cloud	environment.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Degaussing	and	shredding	are	physically destructive	methods	used	against	storage	media,	which	due	to resource	pooling	and	multitenancy,	would	almost	certainly	never	be available	in	a	cloud	environment.	Even	in	the	case	of	a	private	cloud, they	would	be	highly	unlikely	because	multiple	different	systems	and applications	share	the	same	physical	storage.	Overwriting,	although software	based,	would	be	very	difficult	to	ensure	in	a	cloud environment	because	data	is	constantly	moving	between	different systems,	and	ensuring	that	all	locations	are	known,	or	even	able	to	be overwritten,	is	virtually	impossible.

 ### Questions # 5 - Which	key	aspect	of	cloud	computing	allows	the	cloud	customer	toadminister	their	configurations	or	provisioned	services	without	the	need	to interact	or	be	involved	with	the	cloud	provider	and	its	staff?    
A.	Resource	pooling    
B.	Measured	service    
C.	Multitenancy    
D.	On-demand	self-service   
Answer: D.	

On-demand	self-service	allows	a	cloud	customer	to	provision resources	or	change	configurations	on	their	own,	without	the	need	to interact	with	the	staff	of	the	cloud	provider.	This	is	typically accomplished	through	a	web	portal	and	tools	provided	by	the	cloud provider.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	Resource	pooling	and	multitenancy	both pertain	to	having	a	large	pool	of	resources	and	services	that	are	shared between	different	applications	and	customers	with	a	cloud environment,	but	neither	concept	specifically	pertains	to administration.	Measured	service	pertains	to	only	incurring	billing	and charges	for	services	the	cloud	customer	actually	uses,	and	for	the duration	of	their	use,	but	does	not	pertain	to	their	administration.

 ### Questions # 6 - Which	of	the	following	properties	of	an	application	will	lead	to	the	biggestcost-savings	potential	with	a	move	into	a	cloud	environment?     
A.	Heavy	utilization    
B.	Light	utilization    
C.	Cyclical	utilization     
D.	Internal	utilization    
Answer: C.	

An	application	that	experiences	cyclical	utilization,	where	some periods	have	high	utilization	and	others	have	low,	has	the	potential	to realize	substantial	cost	savings	within	a	cloud	environment	due	to measured	service.	With	a	traditional	data	center,	an	application	needs to	be	built	to	handle	the	highest	possible	utilization,	with	substantial resources	sitting	idle	at	other	times.	Within	a	cloud	environment, systems	can	be	expanded	for	high-utilization	periods	and	then	scaled down	during	lower	periods,	thus	saving	money.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	High	utilization	and	low	utilization	steadystates	would	not	realize	costs	savings	in	a	cloud	environment	versus	a traditional	data	center,	where	they	can	be	planned	and	designed	for. Internal	utilization	versus	public	utilization	would	not	result	in	a	cost difference.

 ### Questions # 7 - Which	of	the	following	standards	pertains	to	the	accreditation	ofcryptographic	modules?    
A.	FIPS	140-2     
B.	PCI	DSS     
C.	NIST	800-53    
D.	ISO/IEC	27001    
Answer: A.	

The	FIPS	140-2	criterion	is	published	by	the	federal	government	of the	United	States	and	pertains	to	the	accreditation	of	cryptographic modules.	Although	it	was	published	in	2002,	long	before	cloud computing	came	into	existence,	the	heavy	usage	of	and	reliance	on encryption	within	cloud	computing	makes	it	relevant	to	the	cloud security	professional.

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	The	Payment	Card	Industry	Data	Security Standard	(PCI	DSS)	is	an	industry	regulation,	published	by	the	major credit	card	brands,	and	required	of	vendors	that	utilize	processing	and networks	for	the	major	card	brands.	The	NIST	800-53	regulates systems	and	data	utilized	by	the	US	federal	government	for	all	nonnational	security	systems.	ISO/IEC	27001	is	a	widely	recognized international	security	certification	and	guidelines	program.

 ### Questions # 8 - Which	model	lays	out	a	vision	for	IT	Service	Management,	encompassingbest-practice	recommendations	covering	a	wide	variety	of	IT	services	and operations?     
A.	SABSA    
B.	ITIL    
C.	TOGAF    
D.	NIST	SP	500-293     
Answer: B.	

The	IT	Infrastructure	Library	(ITIL)	is	a	collection	of	papers	and concepts	to	lay	out	a	vision	for	IT	Service	Management	(ITSM).	It	is essentially	a	collection	of	best	practices	to	give	companies	of	all	sizes (but	more	targeted	to	large	companies)	a	framework	for	providing both	IT	services	and	user	support.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	The	Sherwood	Applied	Business	Security Architecture	(SABSA)	provides	a	group	of	components	that	can	be used	in	part	or	whole	as	an	approach	to	security	architecture	of	any system.	The	Open	Group	Architecture	Framework	(TOGAF)	is	meant to	be	an	open	enterprise	architecture	model	that	is	intended	to	be	a high-level	design	approach.	The	NIST	Cloud	Technology	Roadmap, put	out	by	the	NIST	of	the	US	federal	government	in	special publication	“SP	500-293,”	is	a	comprehensive	guide	for	US government	agencies	and	their	use	of	and	migration	to	cloud computing	platforms.

 ### Questions # 9 - Which	phase	of	the	cloud	secure	data	lifecycle	is	where	data	is	viewable	tocustomers	or	users?     
A.	Use    
B.	Share     
C.	Store     
D.	View     
Answer: B.	   

The	“share”	phase	of	the	cloud	secure	data	lifecycle	is	where	data	is made	available	to	the	users	or	customers	of	an	application	or	system.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	The	“use”	phase	is	where	data	is	accessible to	the	application	for	processing	or	modification.	The	“store”	phase	is where	data	is	committed	to	storage	of	any	type.	The	“view”	phase	is not	part	of	the	cloud	secure	data	lifecycle.

 ### Questions # 10 - Which	cloud	storage	type	is	typically	accessed	via	an	API	or	web	servicecall?     
A.	Volume     
B.	Structured     
C.	Unstructured    
D.	Object    
Answer: D.	   

Object	storage	is	data	storage	that	operates	as	an	API	or	a	web service	call.	Rather	than	being	in	a	file	tree	structure	and	accessible	as a	traditional	hard	drive,	data	is	stored	as	objects	in	an	independent system	and	given	a	key	value	for	reference	and	retrieval.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	Volume	storage	is	allocated	to	a	server	with IaaS	and	functions	the	same	as	a	traditional	file	system	that’s	managed by	the	operating	system.	Structured	storage,	used	with	PaaS, resembles	database	storage	with	predefined	structures,	and unstructured	storage	is	also	used	with	PaaS	to	host	support	files	such as	images	and	style	sheets.

 ### Questions # 11 - Which	data	security	and	privacy	practice	uses	an	opaque	value	forsensitive	data	fields	that	can	be	mapped	back	to	the	original	value	if needed?     
A.	Anonymization  
B.	Tokenization      
C.	Obfuscation     
D.	Masking     
Answer: B.	

Tokenization	is	the	practice	of	utilizing	a	random	and	opaque “token”	value	in	data	to	replace	what	otherwise	would	be	a	sensitive or	protected	data	object.	The	token	value	is	usually	generated	by	the application	with	a	means	to	map	it	back	to	the	actual	real	value.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Masking	and	obfuscation	involve	replacing sensitive	values	in	data	sets	with	random	or	garbage	values.	They	are typically	used	when	making	data	sets	for	testing	in	non-production environments,	where	the	format	of	the	data	is	important	but	the	exact values	are	not.	Anonymization	involves	removing	indirect	identifiers from	data	so	that	it	cannot	be	traced	back	to	a	specific	individual.

 ### Questions # 12 - Which	phase	of	the	cloud	data	lifecycle	represents	the	first	opportunity	toapply	security	controls	to	protect	data?    
A.	Create     
B.	Use    
C.	Share     
D.	Store    
Answer: D.	

Immediately	after	the	“create”	phase	has	been	completed,	the	data must	be	committed	to	some	sort	of	storage	system,	such	as	a	database
or	file	system.	This	represents	the	first	time	where	security	controls can	be	applied	to	the	data,	based	on	the	type	of	storage	system	used and	the	classification	of	the	data.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	The	“create”	phase	is	simply	where	data	is created	or	generated,	but	not	until	the	data	is	stored	or	written	can security	controls	be	applied.	The	“use”	and	“share”	phases	occur	after the	“store”	phase,	so	neither	would	be	the	first	instance	where	security controls	can	be	applied.

 ### Questions # 13 - Which	of	the	following	is	NOT	one	of	the	main	methods	of	data	discovery processes?.    
A.	Checksums     
B.	Metadata    
C.	Labels    
D.	Content	analysis    
Answer: A.	  

Checksums,	where	a	value	is	derived	based	on	the	overall	data object,	are	often	used	for	ensuring	the	integrity	of	data.	If	any alterations	to	the	file	have	been	made	from	the	original,	the	checksum of	the	file	will	compute	to	a	different	value.	Checksums	would	not	be used	for	data	discovery.

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Metadata,	labels,	and	content	analysis	are the	three	main	types	of	data	discovery.	Metadata	involves	the	use	of information	about	the	data	(filenames,	creator,	dates,	and	so	on)	to determine	classification.	Labels	use	data	categories	and	their headings,	such	as	database	fields,	to	determine	classification,	and content	analysis	runs	searches	against	the	actual	data	for	pattern matching	and	keywords.

 ### Questions # 14 - Which	jurisdiction	has	implemented	policy	regulations	that	are	known	asthe	“right	to	be	forgotten”	protections?     
A.	United	States     
B.	Russia     
C.	European	Union    
D.	APEC    
Answer: C.	

The	European	Union	is	widely	recognized	as	implementing	the most	comprehensive	and	strong	data	privacy	and	security	regulations. The	“right	to	be	forgotten”	provisions	protect	a	user’s	right	and	ability
to	have	their	presence	and	information	removed	from	search	engine indexes	and	results.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	The	United	States	lacks	a	national	privacy regulation	that	is	universal,	and	Russia	and	the	Asian-Pacific
Economic	Cooperation	(APEC)	have	only	implemented	varying degrees	of	privacy	regulations.	None	has	implemented	requirements as	stringent	or	comprehensive	as	the	EU’s	“right	to	be	forgotten” provisions.

 ### Questions # 15 - Which	of	the	following	functions	can	be	controlled	by	IRM	technologies,where	typical	operating	system	controls	would	not	be	sufficient?     
A.	Read    
B.	Copy     
C.	Delete     
D.	Write   
Answer: B.	   

Information	rights	management	(IRM)	technologies	extend	the security	controls	available	to	protect	data	beyond	those	offered	by	the operating	systems.	The	ability	to	control	the	copying	of	a	file	is	one	of those	controls.	With	standard	operating	system	controls,	if	a	user	can read	a	file,	they	can	also	copy	the	file,	which	is	something	that	IRM can	control.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Read,	delete,	and	write	are	all	operations that	can	be	controlled	by	operating	system	permissions	and	security controls.

 ### Questions # 16 - Which	of	the	following	will	always	dictate	the	minimum	requirements	fordata	retention	and	archiving	periods?     
A.	Company	policies     
B.	Application	needs     
C.	Regulations     
D.	Administrator	requests     
Answer: C.	

Regulatory	requirements,	either	from	law	or	industry,	will	always dictate	the	minimum	retention	period	for	any	log	data	in	order	to maintain	compliance	or	certification.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Company	policies,	administrator	requests, and	any	application	requirements	may	expand	upon	the	minimum requirements	specified	by	regulation,	but	they	cannot	be	strict	without violating	compliance	requirements.

 ### Questions # 17 - Which	of	the	following	event	data	types	is	a	cloud	customer	most	likely	tobe	supplied	with	a	SaaS	implementation?      
A.	Firewall      
B.	Authentication     
C.	Patching      
D.	Billing     
Answer: D.	  

With	the	entire	responsibility	for	both	the	system	and	application being	with	the	cloud	provider	for	a	SaaS	implementation,	the customer	is	mostly	like	going	to	receive	only	very	limited	event	data. Among	the	event	data	types	that	are	universal	for	cloud	customers	to receive	with	SaaS	is	billing	data	for	their	usage	of	services.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	Firewall,	authentication,	and	patching	data will	almost	certainly	not	be	available	to	cloud	customers	in	a	SaaS implementation,	nor	would	they	be	of	much	value	because	the responsibility	for	them	lies	with	the	cloud	provider.

 ### Questions # 18 - Which	security	concept	is	the	most	important	consideration	with	the	useof	an	external	key	management	system?     
A.	Confidentiality     
B.	Availability      
C.	Integrity      
D.	Privacy     
Answer: B.	

With	the	use	of	an	external	key	management	system,	where	the	keys are	hosted	and	managed	on	a	system	that	is	kept	segregated	from	the systems	using	and	depending	on	them,	availability	becomes	the	most pressing	security	concern	for	production	operations.	If	availability	is not	maintained,	especially	with	storage	and	data-at-rest	encryption used	widely	with	cloud	implementations,	an	entire	system	or application	may	be	rendered	useless	and	inaccessible.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	The	confidentiality	of	private	keys	as	well as	their	integrity	are	important	considerations	for	an	external	key management	system,	but	availability	is	the	best	choice	based	on	the example	provided.	Privacy	relates	to	user	data	and	would	not	be pertinent	to	the	example	used	within	the	question.

 ### Questions # 19 - Which	of	the	following	is	not	one	of	the	defined	security	controls domains	within	the	Cloud	Controls	Matrix,	published	by	the	Cloud Security	Alliance?          
A.	Financial      
B.	Human	resources     
C.	Mobile	security         
D.	Identity	and	access	management     
Answer: A.	

Financial	is	not	one	of	the	security	controls	domains	of	the	Cloud Control	Matrix	(CCM).

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Human	resources,	mobile	security,	and identity	and	access	management	are	all	specific	domains	of	the	CCM.

 ### Questions # 20 - Which	concept	is	utilized	by	a	cloud	provider	to	determine	how	toallocate	resources	requested	by	cloud	customers	when	the	cloud infrastructure	does	not	have	enough	resources	to	meet	all	requests?    
A.	Limits    
B.	Reservations    
C.	Holds    
D.	Shares    
Answer: D.	  

The	concept	of	shares	within	a	cloud	environment	is	used	to mitigate	and	control	customer	requests	for	resources,	which	the environment	may	not	have	the	current	capability	to	allow.	Shares work	by	prioritizing	hosts	within	a	cloud	environment	through	a weighting	system	that	is	defined	by	the	cloud	provider.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	Limits	are	put	in	place	to	enforce	maximum utilization	of	memory	or	processing	by	a	cloud	customer.	A reservation	is	a	minimum	resource	that	is	guaranteed	to	a	customer within	a	cloud	environment.	A	hold	is	not	a	concept	within	cloud computing	that	relates	to	the	particulars	of	the	question.

 ### Questions # 21 - Which	type	of	hypervisor	runs	within	a	host	operating	system,	rather	than directly	tied	to	the	underlying	hypervisor	hardware?   
A.	Type	1    
B.	Type	3     
C.	Type	2     
D.	Hosted    
Answer: C.	

A	Type	2	hypervisor	runs	within	a	host	operating	system	rather	than being	tied	directly	to	the	underlying	hardware	in	the	way	a	Type	1 hypervisor	is.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	A	Type	1	hypervisor	is	tied	directly	to	the hardware	of	the	hypervisor	and	does	not	run	within	any	other software.	Both	Type	3	and	“hosted”	hypervisors	are	not	real	types.

### Questions # 22 - What	will	govern	the	level	of	access	and	insight	a	cloud	customer	haswith	the	cloud	provider	they	are	hosting	applications	and	data	with?     
A.	SLAs     
B.	Regulation     
C.	Jurisdiction    
D.	Classification     
Answre A.	

The	service	level	agreement	(SLA)	between	the	cloud	customer	and cloud	provider	will	dictate	and	govern	the	type,	level,	and	immediacy of	access	and	insight	available	with	the	underlying	infrastructure	and operations.

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Both	regulation	and	jurisdiction	may provide	some	requirements	for	access	and	information	from	the	cloud provider	to	the	cloud	customer,	but	neither	is	the	best	answer	in	this case.	Classification	refers	to	the	sensitivity	of	the	data,	but	does	not pertain	to	access	or	insight	that	a	cloud	customer	is	given	with	the cloud	provider.

 ### Questions # 23 - When	is	a	system	vulnerable	within	a	cloud	environment	but	would	not	bewithin	a	traditional	data	center?     
A.	When	powered	off     
B.	During	development     
C.	During	patching     
D.	During	booting     
Answer A.	

Within	a	cloud	environment,	or	any	virtualized	environment,	virtual images	are	files	that	exist	on	a	file	system	(typically	within	object storage	in	a	cloud	environment).	Due	to	this	factor,	even	when	a virtual	machine	is	powered	off,	the	images	are	still	potential vulnerabilities	that	an	attacker	can	attempt	to	exploit.

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Despite	the	unique	nature	of	a	cloud environment	and	virtualization,	there	isn’t	a	significant	difference when	systems	are	being	booted,	patched,	or	are	in	development	as compared	to	a	traditional	data	center.

 ### Questions # 24 - Which	of	the	following	components	is	not	a	key	participant	within	afederated	identity	system?      
A.	User    
B.	Application    
C.	Relying	party    
D.	Identity	provider   
Answer: B.	

Although	access	to	an	application	is	typically	the	end	result	of going	through	a	federated	identity	system,	it	is	not	one	of	the	core components	of	the	actual	federated	system.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	The	user	who	initiates	the	federated	identity process,	the	identity	provider	that	validates	the	user’s	authentication and	releases	their	attributes,	and	the	relying	party	that	consumes	the authentication	and	attribute	assertions	are	all	key	components	of	a federated	identity	system.

 ### Questions # 25 - Which	of	the	following	will	typically	be	used	by	a	cloud	provider	to	offerassurance	of	security	to	cloud	customers	and	mitigate	the	need	for customers	to	audit	the	underlying	infrastructure?    
A.	Contracts    
B.	SLA    
C.	Certification    
D.	Baselines    
Answer: C.	

A	standard	strategy	for	providing	security	assurances	to	cloud customers	is	for	the	cloud	provider	to	obtain	certification	for	its security	controls	and	policies	from	a	prominent	and	reputable certification	source.	This	will	allow	cloud	customers	to	assume security	controls	up	to	the	scope	of	the	certification,	and	then	perform their	own	audits	from	that	point	on.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Contracts	and	SLAs	will	be	used	to	require and	verify	that	certifications	and	other	compliance	strategies	are implemented	and	verified	by	the	cloud	provider,	but	they	are	not themselves	the	source	of	the	assurance.	Baselines,	which	are	used	to ensure	a	level-set	of	system	configurations,	will	often	form	an	integral component	of	certification,	but	this	is	not	the	best	answer	in	this	case.

 ### Questions # 26 - What	metric	is	intended	to	measure	the	duration	of	operational	recovery to	meet	a	predetermined	point	after	a	disaster	has	occurred?    
A.	RPO     
B.	RSL     
C.	SRE     
D.	RTO    
Answer: D.	

The	recovery	time	objective	(RTO)	is	the	time	that	it	would	take	to recover	operations	in	the	event	of	a	disaster	to	the	point	where management’s	objectives	for	BCDR	are	met.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	The	recovery	point	objective	(RPO)	is defined	as	the	amount	of	data	a	company	would	need	to	maintain	and recover	in	order	to	function	at	a	level	acceptable	to	management.	The recovery	service	level	(RSL)	is	a	percentage	measure	of	the	typical total	production	service	level	that	needs	to	be	restored	to	meet	BCDR objectives	in	the	case	of	a	failure.	SRE	is	provided	as	an	answer	but	is not	pertinent	to	the	question.

 ### Questions # 27 - There	are	many	different	causes	that	can	lead	to	a	declared	disaster	for	asystem.	Which	of	the	following	would	not	be	considered	a	reason	for	a declared	disaster	and	the	triggering	of	a	BCDR	plan?     
A.	Earthquake     
B.	Flood      
C.	Key	personnel	loss     
D.	Utility	outage    
Answer: C.	

The	loss	of	key	personnel,	although	detrimental	to	a	system	or operations,	would	not	trigger	a	declared	disaster	or	the	invocation	of	a BCDR	plan	because	it	would	not	directly	affect	a	system	or	its	users, nor	would	it	be	a	reason	to	move	services	or	data	to	an	alternative hosting	location.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	An	earthquake,	flood,	and	utility	outage	are all	widespread	events	that	have	the	potential	to	affect	an	entire	data center,	and	as	such	could	be	reasons	for	the	triggering	of	a	declared disaster	and	invocation	of	a	BCDR	plan.

 ### Questions # 28 - Which	of	the	following	metrics	are	tested	during	a	BCDR	exercise	toensure	management	objectives	are	being	achieved?    
A.	RPO	and	RTO    
B.	RPO	and	costs     
C.	Costs	and	RTO     
D.	Costs	and	downtime    
Answer: A.	

With	any	BCDR	test,	the	main	objective	is	to	ensure	the	BCDR plan	is	designed	to	meet	both	the	recovery	point	objective	(RPO)	and the	recovery	time	objective	(RTO)	established	by	management.

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	During	a	BCDR	test,	the	overall	costs	are not	considered	part	of	the	testing	or	plan.	Downtime	is	provided	as	a similar	concept	to	the	RTO,	but	is	not	the	best	or	correct	response.

 ### Questions # 29 - What	type	of	common	vulnerability	is	exploited	by	sending	commands through	input	fields	in	an	application	in	an	attempt	to	bypass	application security?     
A.	Cross-site	scripting       
B.	Cross-site	request	forgery      
C.	Insecure	direct	object	references     
D.	Injection    
Answer: D.	

An	injection	attack	is	where	a	malicious	actor	sends	commands	or other	arbitrary	data	through	input	and	data	fields	with	the	intent	of having	the	application	or	system	execute	the	code	as	part	of	its	normal processing	and	queries.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	Cross-site	scripting	is	an	attack	where	a malicious	actor	is	able	to	send	untrusted	data	to	a	user’s	browser without	going	through	any	validation	or	sanitization	process,	or	where the	code	is	not	properly	escaped	from	processing	by	the	browser. Insecure	direct	object	references	occur	when	a	developer	has	in	their code	a	reference	to	something	on	the	application	side,	such	as	a database	key,	the	directory	structure	of	the	application,	configuration information	about	the	hosting	system,	or	any	other	information	that pertains	to	the	workings	of	the	application	that	should	not	be	exposed to	users	or	the	network.	A	cross-site	request	forgery	attack	forces	a client	that	a	user	has	used	to	authenticate	to	an	application	to	send forged	requests	under	the	user’s	own	credentials	to	execute	commands and	requests	that	the	application	thinks	are	coming	from	a	trusted client	and	user.

 ### Questions # 30 - What	type	of	security	testing	uses	testers	who	have	knowledge	of	thesystems,	and	in	most	cases	access	to	the	source	code	as	well,	and	is performed	against	offline	systems?     
A.	DAST     
B.	SAST    
C.	Pen    
D.	RASP    
Answer: B.	  

Static	application	security	testing	(SAST)	is	a	method	used	to	test and	analyze	the	code	and	components	of	an	application.	It	is considered	“white-box”	testing	in	that	the	people	running	the	tests have	knowledge	of	and	access	to	the	source	code	and	systems involved.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Dynamic	application	security	testing (DAST)	is	considered	“black	box”	testing	of	an	application	and	is	run against	live	systems.	The	people	running	the	test	do	not	have	any special	knowledge	of	the	system.	Pen	testing	is	typically	a	“blackbox”	test	and	is	run	in	the	same	manner	and	with	the	same	toolsets that	an	attacker	would	attempt	to	use	against	an	application.	Runtime application	self-protection	(RASP)	is	typically	run	against	systems that	have	the	ability	to	tune	and	focus	their	security	measures	based	on actual	environment	variables	and	the	particular	attack	methods	being used	against	them.

 ### Questions # 31 - What	type	of	software	is	often	considered	secured	and	validated	via community	knowledge?    
A.	Proprietary    
B.	Object-oriented     
C.	Open	source     
D.	Scripting     
Answer: C.	

The	most	popular	and	widely	used	open	source	software	packages have	undergone	extensive	code	review,	testing,	collaborative development,	and	scrutiny,	which	is	not	possible	with	proprietary software	packages	that	are	closed	source	and	protected.	With	this	level of	scrutiny	and	the	ability	for	any	organization	to	evaluate	and	analyze the	code	from	these	packages,	many	consider	them	to	be	among	the most	secure	and	stable	packages	available	in	the	industry.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Proprietary	software	is	closed	source	and not	available	for	review	or	validation	outside	of	the	company	that	has created	it,	and	as	such	would	not	be	considered	secure	via	community knowledge.	Both	object-oriented	and	scripting	are	types	of	coding	and software	development	and	do	not	depend	on	community	knowledge for	security.

 ### Questions # 32 - During	which	stage	of	the	SDLC	process	should	security	be	consulted	andbegin	its	initial	involvement?
A.	Testing    
B.	Design     
C.	Development    
D.	Requirement	gathering    
Answer: D.	

Requirements	gathering	and	feasibility	is	the	first	stage,	and	it	is appropriate	for	security	to	be	included	as	part	of	this	stage.	Security should	be	included	at	the	project’s	inception	or	at	least	from	the	very earliest	stages	to	ensure	proper	controls	and	technologies	are	being used,	as	well	as	to	ensure	that	security	is	always	considered	with	each decision	made.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	The	testing,	design,	and	development	phases of	the	SDLC	all	come	after	the	initial	requirements	gathering	phase, and	as	such	they	would	be	too	late	to	begin	to	involve	security	to ensure	project	success	and	objectives	are	being	met.

 ### Questions # 33 - What	security	concept	does	the	letter	R	represent	in	the	DREAD	threat risk	model? 
A.	Reversibility    
B.	Reproducibility      
C.	Redundancy    
D.	Resiliency   
Answer: B.	

The	R	of	the	DREAD	threat	risk	model	refers	to	reproducibility, which	in	this	case	means	a	quantitative	measure	as	to	the	ease	and sophistication	required	to	reproduce	an	exploit.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Reversibility	refers	to	the	ability	for	a	cloud customer	to	completely	remove	all	data	and	services	from	a	cloud environment,	with	assurance	that	the	data	has	been	securely	and completely	removed.	Resiliency	and	redundancy	both	pertain	to	an application	or	service	adjusting	to	problems	or	load	issues	to	maintain an	acceptable	level	of	performance,	but	they	are	not	related	to	the DREAD	threat	risk	model.

 ### Questions # 34 - For	security	purposes,	a	university	keeps	its	student	and	faculty	dataseparated	from	each	other	within	a	system.	What	security	concept	does this	strategy	illustrate?    
A.	Sandboxing     
B.	Isolation     
C.	Segregation    
D.	Compartmentalization    
Answer: A.	

Sandboxing	involves	the	segregation	and	isolation	of	information	or processes	from	other	information	and	processes	within	the	same system	or	application,	typically	for	security	concerns.	This	is generally	used	for	data	isolation,	such	as	keeping	different communities	and	populations	of	users	isolated	from	others	with similar	data.
B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Segregation,	isolation,	and compartmentalization	are	all	similar	concepts,	but	none	is	the	correct term	in	this	case.

 ### Questions # 35 - Which	of	the	following	would	be	appropriate	to	use	in	conjunction	withan	RSA	token	for	a	multifactor	authentication	system?     
A.	Thumb	drive   
B.	Access	card     
C.	Password    
D.	Mobile	device	code	generator    
Answer: C.	

A	password	would	be	appropriate	to	use	in	conjunction	with	an RSA	token	for	a	multifactor	authentication	system	because	a	password is	something	a	user	knows,	whereas	the	RSA	token	represents something	the	user	has.	As	such,	they	are	factors	from	two	different categories.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	An	access	card,	thumb	drive,	or	mobile device	with	a	code	generator	would	not	be	appropriate	to	use	in conjunction	with	an	RSA	token	for	a	multifactor	authentication	system because	each	one	is	something	a	user	possesses.	Therefore,	they	are all	the	same	type	of	factor.

 ### Questions # 36 - What	is	the	recommended	relative	humidity	level	for	a	data	center,	perrecommendations	from	ASHRAE?    
A.	40–60	percent     
B.	20–30	percent    
C.	50–70	percent    
D.	24–36	percent    
Answer: A.	

The	recommended	relative	humidity	rate	for	a	data	center,	per	the American	Society	of	Heating,	Refrigeration,	and	Air	Conditioning Engineers	(ASHRAE),	is	40–60	percent.

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	None	of	the	other	options	available	is	the recommended	relative	humidity	rate	per	ASHRAE.

 ### Questions # 37 - Which	protocol	allows	for	the	use	of	storage	commands	over	a	TCPnetwork	rather	than	a	physical	connection?    
A.	IPSec     
B.	SCSI    
C.	VPN    
D.	iSCSI   
Answer: D.	

The	most	prevalent	communications	protocol	for	network-based storage	is	iSCSI,	which	is	a	protocol	that	allows	for	the	transmission and	use	of	SCSI	commands	and	features	over	a	TCP-based	network.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	SCSI	is	used	for	storage	commands	and functions	over	a	physical	connection,	not	a	network.	IPSec	is	used	for secure	communications	and	encryption	between	two	devices,	and	a virtual	private	network	(VPN)	is	used	to	allow	for	secure	connections and	tunneling	from	public	networks	into	a	trusted	zone.

 ### Questions # 38 - DRS	is	used	for	managing	all	aspects	of	clustered	systems.	Which	of	thefollowing	represents	what	DRS	stands	for?     
A.	Dynamic	resource	state     
B.	Distributed	resource	scheduling     
C.	Distributed	resource	selection     
D.	Dynamic	resource	scheduling     

Answer: B.	

Distributed	resource	scheduling	(DRS)	is	used	within	all	clustering systems	as	the	method	for	clusters	to	provide	high	availability, scaling,	management,	and	workload	distribution	and	balancing	of	jobs and	processes.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	None	of	the	other	options	presented	is	what
the	acronym	DRS	stand	for.

 ### Questions # 39 - Which	strategy	involves	using	a	fake	production	system	to	lure	attackersin	order	to	learn	about	their	tactics?     
A.	IDS     
B.	Honeypot    
C.	IPS     
D.	Firewall    
Answer: B.	

A	honeypot	is	a	system	isolated	from	the	production	system	but designed	to	appear	to	an	attacker	as	part	of	the	production	system	and containing	valuable	data.	However,	the	data	on	a	honeypot	is	bogus data,	and	it	is	set	up	on	an	isolated	network	so	that	any	compromise	of it	cannot	impact	any	other	systems	within	the	environment.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	An	intrusion	detection	system	(IDS) monitors	for	specific	types	of	network	signatures	and	events	and	then alerts	staff	to	any	such	instances,	whereas	an	intrusion	prevention system	(IPS)	can	actively	block	such	events,	rather	than	just	alerting about	them.	A	firewall	is	used	to	block	network	traffic	based	on	origin and	destination	IP	addresses,	combined	with	port	and	protocol.


 ### Questions # 40 - Which	network	protocol	allows	for	the	centralized	administration	andconfiguration	of	network	settings	for	systems	hosted	within	the	network?     
A.	DNS      
B.	IPSec     
C.	DHCP     
D.	VLAN    
Answer: C.	

The	Dynamic	Host	Configuration	Protocol	(DHCP)	is	used	to assign	an	IP	address	and	the	associated	network	configuration	settings to	a	system	within	a	network	from	a	centralized	administrative	system, rather	than	having	the	settings	on	the	host	themselves.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Domain	Name	Service	(DNS)	resolves common	names	for	servers,	systems,	or	services	to	their	associated	IP address	for	network	connectivity.	IPSec	is	used	for	secure communications	and	network	transmissions	between	two	hosts. VLANs	are	used	for	segregating	a	physical	network	into	logical networks.

 ### Questions # 41 - What	type	of	management	involves	minimizing	the	impact	of	disruptionsto	services	or	operations?     
A.	Incident	management     
B.	Problem	management       
C.	Continuity	management      
D.	Availability	management      
Answer: A.	

Incident	management	is	focused	on	limiting	the	impact	of disruptive	events	on	an	organization	and	their	services,	and	returning their	state	to	full	operational	status	as	quickly	as	possible.

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Continuity	management,	or	business continuity	management,	is	focused	on	planning	for	the	successful restoration	of	systems	and	services	following	an	unexpected	outage, incident,	or	disaster.	The	focus	of	problem	management	is	to	analyze and	identify	potential	issues	and	to	put	processes	and	mitigations	in place	to	prevent	predictable	problems	from	ever	occurring	in	the	first place.	Availability	management	is	focused	on	making	sure	system resources,	processes,	personnel,	and	toolsets	are	properly	allocated and	secured	to	meet	SLA	requirements	for	performance.

 ### Questions # 42 - One	approach	to	dealing	with	risk	is	often	compared	to	taking	insurance against	risk	becoming	realized.	What	type	of	risk	mitigation	strategy	does this	refer	to?    
A.	Accept    
B.	Avoid    
C.	Mitigate    
D.	Transfer    
Answer: D.	

Risk	transfer	is	the	process	of	having	another	entity	assume	the	risk from	the	organization.	One	thing	to	note,	though,	is	that	risk	cannot always	be	transferred	to	another	entity.	A	prime	example	of	transfer	is through	the	use	of	insurance	policies	to	cover	the	financial	costs	of successful	risk	exploits;	however,	this	will	not	cover	all	issues	related to	risk	transference	because	an	organization	can	face	nonfinancial penalties,	such	as	the	loss	of	reputation,	business,	or	trust.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	Through	risk	mitigation,	an	organization takes	steps,	such	as	buying	new	systems	or	technologies,	to	try	to prevent	any	exploits	from	happening.	In	an	instance	where	the	cost	to mitigate	outweighs	the	cost	of	accepting	the	risk	and	dealing	with	any possible	consequences,	an	organization	may	opt	to	simply	deal	with an	exploit	if	and	when	it	occurs.	Risk	avoidance	is	when	an organization	opts	to	limit	or	remove	vulnerable	services	or	systems rather	than	taking	on	another	risk	strategy	for	them.

 ### Questions # 43 - An	eDiscovery	order	typically	encompasses	data	that	fits	within	all	of	thefollowing	categories	of	an	organization’s	processes	except	which	one?     
A.	Possession     
B.	Custody     
C.	Control     
D.	Creation    
Answer: D.	

Whether	or	not	an	organization	is	the	creator	of	specific	data	is	not one	of	the	core	components	of	what	typically	encompasses	an eDiscovery	order.

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	An	eDiscovery	order	typically	encompasses data	that	is	under	the	control,	custody,	or	possession	of	an organization.

 ### Questions # 44 - Which	United	States	program	was	designed	to	attempt	to	bridge	thedifferences	between	US	and	European	privacy	requirements	for	the purposes	of	commerce?    
A.	GLBA     
B.	Safe	harbor     
C.	HIPAA      
D.	SOX     
Answer: B.	     

The	Safe	Harbor	regulations	were	developed	by	the	Department	of Commerce	and	meant	to	bridge	the	gap	between	the	privacy regulations	of	the	European	Union	and	the	United	States.	With	the lack	of	an	adequate	privacy	law	or	protection	from	the	federal	level	in the	US,	European	privacy	regulations	generally	prohibit	the	exporting (or	sharing)	of	personally	identifiable	information	(PII)	from	Europe to	the	United	States.

A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	The	Gramm-Leach-Bliley	Act	(GLBA)	is focused	on	PII	as	it	relates	to	financial	institutions.	The	Health Insurance	Portability	and	Accountability	Act	(HIPAA)	is	focused	on the	security	controls	for	and	confidentiality	of	medical	records.	The Sarbanes-Oxley	(SOX)	Act	regulates	accounting	and	financial
practices	used	by	organizations.

 ### Questions # 45 - What	type	of	reports	are	considered	restricted	and	commonly	used	todetail	the	financial	reporting	controls	of	an	organization?    
A.	SAS-70     
B.	SOC	2     
C.	SOC	1     
D.	SOC	3    
Answer: C.	

The	SOC	1	reports	are	the	effective	direct	replacement	for	the	SAS70	reports.	They	are	focused	specifically	on	controls	for	financial reporting.	The	SOC	1	reports	are	considered	restricted-use	reports	in that	they	are	intended	for	a	small	and	limited	scope	of	controls auditing,	and	are	not	intended	to	be	expanded	into	greater	use.	They are	focused	specifically	on	internal	controls	as	they	relate	to	financial reporting.

A,	B,	and	D	are	incorrect.	Although	SAS-70	reports	are	very	similar	to SOC	1	reports,	they	have	been	deprecated	and	replaced	by	the	SOC	1 reports,	and	as	such	this	is	not	the	best	answer.	SOC	2	reports	expand greatly	on	SOC	1	reports	and	apply	to	a	broad	range	of	service organizations	and	types,	whereas	SOC	1	is	only	for	financial organizations.	SOC	3	reports	are	similar	to	SOC	2	reports	in	scope, design,	and	structure,	with	the	main	difference	between	SOC	2	and SOC	3	being	the	audience	they	are	intended	for:	SOC	3	reports	are designed	for	public	consumption.

 ### Questions # 46 - Which	of	the	following	represents	the	most	commonly	used	metrics	forrisk	categorization?     
A.	Minimal,	low,	moderate,	high,	critical     
B.	Low,	medium,	high      
C.	Low,	moderate,	high     
D.	Low,	medium,	high,	critical     
Answer: A.	

The	most	commonly	used	metrics	for	risk	categorization	are minimal,	low,	moderate,	high,	and	critical.

B,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	The	other	options	represent	some	but	not	all of	the	metrics	commonly	used	for	risk	categorization.

 ### Questions # 47 - When	forming	a	contract	with	a	cloud	provider,	which	of	the	following would	not	be	a	direct	component	of	the	actual	contract?     
A.	Definitions    
B.	Incident	response    
C.	Metrics     
D.	Uptime	requirements     
Answer: D.	

Uptime	(or	availability)	requirements	are	not	typically	a	direct component	of	a	contract	with	a	cloud	provider.	The	uptime	and availability	requirements	would	be	a	key	component	of	the	service level	agreement	(SLA).

A,	B,	and	C	are	incorrect.	The	contract	should	include	agreed-upon definitions	of	any	terms	and	technologies.	How	the	cloud	provider will	handle	incident	response	for	any	security	or	operational	incidents, as	well	as	how	communication	will	be	provided	to	the	cloud	customer, are	key	components	of	a	contract.	The	contract	will	clearly	define what	criteria	should	be	measured	as	far	as	system	performance	and availability	are	concerned,	as	well	as	the	agreement	between	the	cloud customer	and	cloud	provider	as	to	how	these	criteria	will	be	collected, measured,	quantified,	and	processed.

 ### Questions # 48 - Modern	systems	and	applications	bridge	many	different	services	andsystems.	What	is	the	overall	management	of	an	entire	system	commonly referred	to	as?    
A.	Holistic	management    
B.	Supply-chain	management     
C.	Comprehensive	management    
D.	Configuration	management     
Answer: B.	   

With	the	nature	of	modern	applications	being	built	on	a	myriad	of different	components	and	services,	the	supply	chain	of	any	system	or application	can	rapidly	expand	to	a	scale	far	outside	a	single organization.
 		A,	C,	and	D	are	incorrect.	The	other	options	provided	are	similarsounding	terms	but	none	is	the	appropriate	answer	for	this	question.
