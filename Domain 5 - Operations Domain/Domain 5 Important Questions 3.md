A. Follow ISO standards to identify and preserve the data.            
B.	Engage third- party forensic professionals.                                   
C.	Follow his cloud provider’s best practices to identify and preserve the data.               
D.	Request that his cloud provider perform the forensic efforts.                                 

### Question # 92 - Which of the following factors would probably most affect the design of a cloud datacenter?                
A. Geographic location                  
B.	Proximity to population centers               
C.	Cost                
D.	Security requirements                    

### Question # 93 - Rick is creating a policy defining his organization’s change management process. Which of the following is not a common change management policy element?               
A.	Defining the composition of the change management board               
B.	The change management process itself                
C.	A requirement to prevent deviation from the baselines established in the policy                      
D.  Enforcement measures                   

### [important tricky] Question # 94 - Which of the following [cloud datacenter functions] do [not] have to be performed on isolated networks?                 
A.	Customer access provision

D.	Customer production activities                    

### Question # 95 - When cloud computing professionals use the phrase ping, power, pipe, which of the following characteristics is [not] being described?       
A.	Logical connectivity                  
B.	Human interaction                     
C.	Electricity                   
D.	Facility space                      

### [important knowledge] Question # 96 - You are the security manager for a small retail business involved mainly in direct e-commerce transactions with individual customers (members of the public). The bulk of your market is in Asia, but you do fulfill orders globally. Your company has [its own datacenter] located within its headquarters building in Hong Kong, but it also uses a [public cloud environment] for [contingency backup and archiving purposes]. Your cloud provider is changing its business model at the end of your contract term, and you have to find a new provider. In choosing providers, [which tier of the Uptime Institute rating system should you be looking for], if [minimizing] cost is your ultimate goal?                         
A. 1           
B. 3             
C. 4               
D. 8                  

### [important] Question # 97 - Isaac is the IT manager for a [small surgical center]. His organization is reviewing upgrade options for its current, on- premises datacenter. The organization wants to increase its disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities [without making significant investments in staffing or technology]. Which of the following options should Isaac recommend?                 
A.	Building a completely new datacenter.                                 
B.	Adding additional DR/BC capabilities to the existing datacenter.                
C.	Moving to a cloud- hosted datacenter.                   
D.	Staying with the current datacenter.                         

### Question # 98 - What does chain- of- custody documentation and tracking help with?                   
A.	Nonrepudiation.              
B.	Plausible deniability.                  
C.	Data tampering by investigators.                 
D.	Engaging with law enforcement.                    

### Question # 99 - Ben wants to provide logical separation between two network segments. What technology is often used to define networks for this purpose?     
A.	DHCP.              
B.	VLANs.                  
C.	VPNs.                     
D.	STP.                   

### Question # 100 - When designing a cloud datacenter, which of the following aspects is not necessary to ensure continuity of operations during contingency operations?                      
A.	Access to clean water.                 
B.	Broadband data connection.                     
C.	Extended battery backup.                        
D.	Physical access to the datacenter.                          


### Chapter 5: Domain 5: Cloud Security Operations

Question # 1.	C. A service-level agreement (SLA) defines service-level targets and the responsibilities of the IT service provider and customer. An OLA (operational level agreement) is an internal agreement between the IT service provider and another part of the same organization and supports the service provider’s delivery of the service. Service acceptance criteria (SAC) are the criteria used to determine whether a service meets its quality and functionality goals. Finally, a service-level requirement (SLR) defines the requirements of a service from the customer’s perspective.

Question # 2.	C. Proactive customer communications is key to managing expectations. Reactive communications are often used for data breach notification, regulatory compliance, and problem management.

Question # 3.	C. Juanita knows that the major cloud vendors provide their own customized versions of Linux that often include additional agents and tools to help them work better with the provider’s infrastructure. She should verify that this is the case, but it is the most likely scenario for a freshly built system as described.

Question # 4.	A. When managing systems at scale in the cloud, Ben knows that the best option is often to use the cloud IaaS vendor’s tools, particularly because they are typically designed to handle both operating systems that may have special features to work in the vendor’s environment and applications.

Question # 5.	D. Jason knows that cloud service providers typically do not allow direct or third- party audits of their systems and services but that they do provide audit results to customers.

Question # 6.	A. A cloud hardware security module (HSM) is used to create, store, and manage secrets.

Question # 7.	B. Charles knows that his situation calls for an infrastructure as code design, which uses code and configuration files or variables to allow rapid deployment using scripts and automated tools. A CI/CD pipeline will often leverage infrastructure as code and automation tools, but it doesn’t directly meet this need. APIs (application programming interfaces) are used to access data from services, and check- in/checkout design was made up for this question.

Question # 8.	A. From a service continuity management perspective, the number of business processes with continuity agreements is the only relevant answer from this list. Understanding the number of business practices that have continuity planning in place and assessing which gaps in coverage are critical is a common practice to improve service continuity.

Question # 9.	B. Agile and DevOps are well suited to rapid release cycles, with continuous integration and continuous delivery processes. Waterfall and spiral both tend to take longer periods of time for each release, and RAD is not as widely adopted and not as release focused.

Question # 10.	B. Assessing results occurs at the end of the seven- step process, helping provide feedback into the next cycle’s vision determination phase.

Question # 11.	A. Maintenance mode migrates virtual machines to other hosts or waits until they are powered down to allow for hardware or other maintenance. Tim knows that he’ll need to ensure all VMs are migrated or shut down and that he can then perform maintenance.

Question # 12.	A. Kathleen should look for a security information and event management (SIEM) tool. They’re used to centralized log collection, analysis, and detection capabilities and often have automated methods of finding issues and alerting on them. An IPS (intrusion prevention system) is used to detect and stop attacks, a CASB (cloud application security broker) is used to control and manage access to cloud services, and MITRE is a U.S. government–funded research organization with a heavy focus on security work.

Question # 13.	B. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is an encryption protocol used to secure data in transit. VLANs are used to logically separate network segments, DNSSEC is intended to provide security to domain name system requests, and DHCP provides IP addresses and other network configuration information to systems automatically.

Question # 14.	C. Blocking inbound connections to port 22, the default SSH port will stop attackers and third parties from outside of the network from accessing SSH as long as it hasn’t been changed to another port. TCP 3389 is associated with RDP.

Question # 15.	B. A configuration management database (CMDB) is frequently used in mature standards- based configuration management environments where it stores both configuration management and information about relationships between configuration items (CIs). CRMs are customer relationship management tools and aren’t part of the CCSP exam. A change catalog was made up for this question.

Question # 16.	B. Maria knows that PaaS environments are patched by the vendor and that she does not need to perform patching of the software or cloud service. She may, however, have to decide when to adopt patches or versions— although she won’t be able to delay adopting new versions forever!

Question # 17.	C. The ITIL subprocesses for availability management are designing services for availability, availability testing, and availability monitoring and reporting. Even if you’re not familiar with ITIL, thinking about a standards- based approach to availability might help you— design, testing, and monitoring are all logical steps in a process like this.

Question # 18.	B. Vendors are the least likely to have contractual or regulatory requirements that mean that they must be notified. Vendors often have to tell their customers about breaches, but customers typically do not need to tell their vendors!

Question # 19.	A. Megan’s next step once she has an inventory is to create a baseline. With that in hand she can establish a CMB, deploy new assets configured to meet the baseline, and document deviations that the CMB approves if needed.

Question # 20.	B. Guest operating system virtualization tools add additional functionality like use of GPUs, shared clipboards, and drag and drop between guest operating systems, shared folders, and similar features that require additional integration between the guest OS and the underlying hypervisor and hardware.

Question # 21.	D. The security review objective focuses on whether security practices and procedures align to risk tolerance for the organization and includes verification and testing like an SOC 2 Type 2 audit does. Design, testing, and management of incidents involve the topics they describe.

Question # 22.	B. Ensuring that the code itself is secure in an automated process requires a tool that can be run as part of the process. That means that the only option from the list that is viable is an automated review of code. Manual static code review isn’t a good fit for a CI/CD pipeline in most cases due to speed requirements. WAFs and IPSs can help protect the application, but again, they don’t test the code or make the application itself more secure.

Question # 23.	B. Since IaaS provides the customer with access to and control over some of the network, they must take responsibility for network- based risks. The IaaS provider provides services and infrastructure, and thus must take responsibility for some of the network- based risks as well. Third- party incident responders do not play a role in risk responsibility in this model.

Question # 24.	B. Configuration management typically starts with baselining. While policies and documentation are important, creating a baseline allows organizations to understand what they have and what state it is in, a critical part of the change management practice.

Question # 25.	D. Network latency is the critical factor when transaction volume is key. Bandwidth is less critical for small transactions, even when there are thousands of them. Routes may influence all of these options but aren’t as critical as the impact they have on the traffic.

Question # 26.	A. Azure’s best practices suggest creating disk snapshots for both the VM’s operating system and data disks, safely storing the snapshots, then comparing hashes between the images and the originals. Comparing the hashes of a snapshot to a copy won’t validate it against the original, VMs can’t be exported as hashes, and disk images aren’t signed in a way that makes sense for this type of forensic use. If you’d like to read the full practice document for more detail, you can find it at https://docs.microsoft.com/en- us/azure/ architecture/example- scenario/forensics.

Question # 27.	A. Businesses typically don’t manage customer capacity. Instead, they would assess their own capacity, known as business capacity management.

Question # 28.	B. Data breach regulations typically focus on customer notification. Nick should work with legal counsel to ensure that his organization is compliant with any notification requirements for his industry and location.

Question # 29.	B. Valerie should carefully document the chain of custody for the disk images so that they can be considered valid for potential legal action. Legal hold is the process for preserving data for legal action, not for documenting actions taken with disk images and other forensic artifacts. Seizure is a type of acquisition but isn’t mentioned here, and disposal would occur after the potential legal case.

Question # 30.	C. Tagging is a critical part of instance scheduling, but even more so for large numbers of instances. It allows schedules to be easily applied to all instances with the proper tags. Since Asha wants to use her cloud provider’s scheduling, a third party does not meet her requirements. Auto- scheduling was made up for this question, and disabling unused instances helps with spend but doesn’t help more than tagging would for scheduling.

Question # 31.	C. Adding new hardware to increase performance is not an element of hardening. Hardening is the process of provisioning a specific element (in this case, a host) against attack. Audits don’t protect against attacks; they only detect and direct responses to attacks.

Question # 32.	A. Automated patching systems can cause disruptions if a bad patch is released or if there is an installation problem that is not detected. That means that a human is often in the loop for patching, or that patches are installed in nonproduction environments first where they can be validated prior to further installations. Automated systems typically do have abilities to report on patches that fail installation and on systems that do not have patches in place, and it is a desirable feature to speed patching and patch accuracy via automation.

Question # 33.	B. The management systems control the entirety of the virtual environment and are therefore extremely valuable and need to be protected accordingly. When possible, isolating those management systems, both physically and virtually, is optimum.

Question # 34.	B. ITIL v4 categorizes deployment management as part of release management.

Question # 35.	C. Carlos knows that virtual machines use virtualized processors and that temperature and voltages can’t be tracked for virtual CPUs. He can track load, and most operating systems have a built- in method for doing so. If voltages and temperature are an ongoing concern, he will need to monitor them at the underlying operating system, hardware, or hypervisor level.

Question # 36.	C. Megan is a process owner and is responsible for the fit to purpose for the continual service improvement effort. Continual service improvement managers (CSI managers) improve ITSM processes and services. Process architects ensure that processes work together and support each other effectively, and customers consume or purchase services.

Question # 37.	D. Felicia wants to perform firewall- like rules- based filtering, which is a function of network security groups. Honeypots are used to capture and observe attacker behaviors, and IDSs and IPSs are used to detect and, in the case of IPSs, potentially prevent attacks based on behaviors and signatures.

Question # 38.	B. Risk can’t be entirely prevented, but it can be drastically reduced. Hardware redundancy, local sharing and balancing, and failure mode design are all common practices when designing redundancy into cloud datacenters.

Question # 39.	A. Cloud providers who are PCI-compliant will typically provide an attestation of compliance upon request. This type of documentation is important for regulators as part of compliance validation. SOC audits don’t specifically test PCI compliance, and most vendors will not allow customers to conduct PCI assessments of their underlying infrastructure.

Question # 40.	A. IaaS vendors typically allow customers to scan their own internal systems but may recommend that certain types of instances with lower resources are not scanned to avoid disruption. While vendors may provide scanning tools, they typically don’t require customers to use them in an IaaS environment. Since external scans can inadvertently impact other customers, external scanning is typically prohibited or limited, and scheduling a time and date may be required for more advanced or specialized testing.

Question # 41.	B. Using load balancing to drain load from existing systems and then replacing them with new, patched instances is a common best practice for cloud- hosted service environment patching. Manual and scripted patching can cause outages, as could re- IPing as systems are swapped over.

Question # 42.	B. Disabling logging would prevent administrators from diagnosing problems. Transferring users, preventing new connections, and notifying customers are all common practices when entering maintenance mode.

Question # 43.	C. A virtual trusted platform module (vTPM) is the only solution that will meet Jack’s needs. HSMs (hardware security modules) are used to create, store, and manage secrets, including cryptographic keys and certificates, but aren’t used for boot security. Cloud TPM was made up for this question, but hardware and cloud HSMs do exist.

Question # 44.	D. Yarif is running a Type 2 hypervisor, which is defined as a hypervisor that runs on top of an operating system rather than on bare metal like a Type 1 hypervisor. Classic and advanced hypervisors are not commonly used terms.

Question # 45.	C. While ITIL focuses on identification, containment, resolution, and maintenance, the overall goal is restore service as soon as possible after an incident. It does not focus on third- party responders. Problem escalations to incidents are part of identification but aren’t the main goal, nor is identifying incidents to allow response.

Question # 46.	A. Incidents are defined in ITIL as interruptions of normal service, including reductions in the quality of services that may violate an SLA. Problem management resolves the cause of problems, while incident response restores services to normal levels.

Question # 47.	D. All problems are potential causes of incidents, but not all problems result in incidents.

Question # 48.	D. The number of individuals impacted is of interest to customers and management but is not a useful KPI for availability.

Question # 49.	C. Information security policies— particularly what ITIL calls “underpinning information security policies”— are the basis of security management in ITIL.

Question # 50.	C. In a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline, automated testing is conducted and the code must pass testing before code is released. Human intervention or approval is not typically required for CI/CD pipelines.

Question # 51.	B. Snapshots are the most common means of capturing disk images from virtual machines in IaaS environments. Using forensic image acquisition tools can be challenging in cloud environments due to a lack of access to the underlying hardware. DBAN is a wiping tool, and file copy utilities often don’t provide a complete forensically sound copy, although they may be the only option in some cases.

Question # 52.	C. These are examples of infrastructure- as- code tools. While Agile pipelines may use Terraform, they would do so as part of an infrastructure as code strategy. They aren’t specifically used for incident response or legal hold strategies but could be leveraged for both, once again as part of an infrastructure as code solution.

Question # 53.	A. ISO 20000- 1 describes service management. ISO 27001 describes an information security management system. ITIL is not an ISO standard, nor is COBIT— in fact, they’re their own standards.

Question # 54.	B. A security information and event manager (SIEM) is the ideal tool for this purpose. A network operations center (NOC) and an IPS (intrusion prevention system) won’t centralize logs and incident information, and DLP (data loss prevention) is intended to stop data from leaving an organization.

Question # 55.	B. Unlike an IDS, an IPS needs to be placed in- line with traffic. This means that an IPS can block legitimate traffic if it is improperly identified or if the IPS fails in a closed state. An IDS cannot fail open or closed, as it is not in- line. Both IDSs and IPSs can use signature and behavior- based detection.

Question # 56.	C. Turning on flow logging can provide the visibility Amanda wants. Flows show which IP address contacted another IP address, the source and destination ports, and the volume of data. None of the other types of logging listed will be as useful for this task.

Question # 57.	A. AI features in SIEM devices are often used to analyze and learn network traffic patterns, then use log correlation and threat intelligence features to identify unexpected and potentially malicious behavior while leveraging learning capabilities. Log correlation and threat intelligence alone will not do this, and reporting is needed afterward.

Question # 58.	A. A typical DHCP response will provide a default gateway, a subnet mask, DNS server information, and an IP address for the host to use. It does not assign MAC addresses to systems— that’s a hardware- level setting, and it doesn’t define a default route, just a default gateway, nor does it provide firewall rule definitions.

Question # 59.	D. Using secure boot, disabling cut and paste between VMs and the console and removing unnecessary hardware are all common security practices. Since the virtual machine console is equivalent to direct access to the system, use of the console should be limited to only critical actions and the virtualization management platform should be used for the majority of actions.

Question # 60.	A. Honeypots are used to capture attack traffic for study but aren’t used to stop attacks. Firewalls, security groups, and IPSs are all used to stop attacks by preventing malicious traffic from entering a network.

Question # 61.	A. Using alternate CPU architectures isn’t a common high availability technique. Using multiple vendors, having SLAs in place, and using self-hosted failover capabilities are all methods that can achieve this goal.

Question # 62.	A. Susan’s outage points to a need for availability management. Susan may invest in redundant systems, additional monitoring, or other practices and design elements that can ensure her organization’s website will be more resilient and thus more available.

Question # 63.	A. The only data that Li is likely to be able to obtain for forensic investigation is log files. Disk images, VM snapshots, and network packet capture data require lower- level access to systems and the network than an SaaS provider will normally make available.

Question # 64.	B. Service capacity management measures performance and checks it against requirements set in SLAs and service-level requirements. Business capacity management involves interpreting business needs into requirements for services and architecture. Component capacity management focuses on the actual components of an infrastructure. Finally, contract capacity management is not an ISO/IEC 20000- 1 configuration management subprocess.

Question # 65.	D. An SOC, or security operations center, can be physical or virtual, and typically consists of a team that monitors for security events on an ongoing basis. An SOC team is likely to use a SIEM (security information and event management) tool. NAS is network attached storage, and SCCM is the name for Microsoft’s now- outmoded Systems Center Configuration Manager, now branded as Endpoint Configuration Manager.

Question # 66.	C. Hui’s organization is using a cloud orchestration technology to automate tasks in their cloud environment. That may include scheduling, but it covers a much broader set of tasks than just scheduling. Maintenance mode is used to remove running systems from a VM cluster to allow for hardware or software upgrades. Abstraction is a term that describes a means of hiding the details of a system, often as a way of making management or other tasks simpler.

Question # 67.	B. Megan is using an artificial intelligence (AI)- based tool that learns from the data it is exposed to and improves its capabilities. An IPS looks for malicious or unwanted network traffic and can block it. Log analysis may be involved in Megan’s tasks, but the problem describes far more than log analysis, and forensic data capture is done as part of investigations.

Question # 68.	A. Jim has deployed a honeypot, a system designed to capture attacker tools and techniques to allow for analysis. Honeynets are networks set up in a similar manner to detect network attacks and attack techniques. Darknets are unused IP ranges that are instrumented to look for unexpected traffic indicating probes by potential attackers. Bastion hosts are used to provide secure access from a lower security zone to a higher security zone.

Question # 69.	D. Olivia knows that once the data or artifacts have been identified, preservation is the next step. Even if you’re not familiar with digital forensics techniques, you can consider the flow for a likely forensic capture process. Analysis, documentation, and presentation can’t be done until data is captured!

Question # 70.	D. IaC can cause errors to spread quickly. It actually helps increase consistency by removing opportunities for human error, it is easily updated, and it increases speed in most cases.

Question # 71.	A. The benefits of any clustered environment come at the cost of higher prices. Keith should expect to spend more money, but gain performance, availability and reliability, and capacity depending on his configuration and design choices.

Question # 72.	A. ITIL’s configuration identification subprocess includes identifying and specifying the attributes for each configuration item type and subcomponent and the relationships between each CI or subcomponent and others in the organization. Configuration control focuses on managing changes in the configuration management system. Configuration verification and audit is a single subprocess and validates that configurations match what is expected.

Question # 73.	A. The only metric among those listed that is typically available to customers in an infrastructure as a service environment is CPU utilization to help track usage.

Question # 74.	C. CIs (configuration items) are the components or services that are managed as part of a configuration management effort. Configuration models are used to evaluate changes and causes of incidents. Configuration records are the records that describe configuration item relationships and settings. Service assets include a range of things that allow organizations to deliver services including third party vendor services.

Question # 75.	D. While bandwidth, compute, and storage usage are all typically measured and billed, latency is usually not directly charged for. Instead, providers are likely to provide a distinct low- latency service if they charge for latency- related items.

Question # 76.	A. Customers are typically unable to obtain forensic data from the underlying infrastructure as a service environment. Memory for the instance, disk volumes, and logs are all common cloud forensic artifacts.

Question # 77.	D. SaaS providers are unlikely to allow third parties to scan their production services. While Selah could just scan her provider anyway, this is often prohibited in contracts that customers sign with their provider. Instead, Selah should ask the vendor about their patching and scanning practices to determine if they are appropriate to her organization’s risk tolerance and to see if documentation or attestation of practices like an SOC audit is available.

Question # 78.	C. If backups aren’t working properly, or cannot be restored, checking all of the other actions described won’t be of use.

Question # 79.	B. A number of ISO standards related to forensics exist, including 27037, 27041, 27043, and 27050- 1. ISO 27001 covers the best practice standards for information security management, and 27002 describes security controls. The ISO 9000 series covers quality management.

Question # 80.	D. Security operations centers typically do not provide eDiscovery services. They do take on threat and intelligence monitoring, incident response and recovery, threat and vulnerability management, and data protection tasks, among many others.

Question # 81.	B. Ryan’s best option is to use GitHub’s APIs to download the repository and then to store it in a secure location. Relying on GitHub’s own backup practices leaves GitHub in control of the code and Ryan vulnerable to outages, and reliance on third- party sites doesn’t give Ryan control of the backups either.

Question # 82.	A. ISO/IEC 20000- 1 focuses on business capacity management, service capacity management, and component capacity management.

Question # 83.	D. Release and deployment plans focus on creating and deploying releases. Lifecycle management is handled under other sections of the ISO standard and not within RDM plans.

Question # 84.	A. ISO/IEC 20000- 1 requires that organizations establish, approve, and communicate their information security policy. If you’re not familiar with ISO/IEC 20000-1  or similar standards, review the list of answers for unlikely answers— like requirements for third- party review. Using a standardized template can help to narrow down answers for questions like these.

Question # 85.	B. Distributed resource scheduling in VMWare moves virtual machines from heavily loaded hosts to those with more resources available to help balance the load across the cluster. Automatic instance management and instance segregation were made up for this question, and round- robin load balancing is a form of load balancing where requests are distributed to each server in a cluster as they come in based on a list.

Question # 86.	D. The amount of data stored on a drive isn’t considered a hardware monitoring item. Powered- on time, temperature, and drive health are all elements of hardware monitoring.

Question # 87.	C. The missing fourth item should be agreement sign- off and service activation, including service-level agreements and service acceptance criteria. Pricing is not part of ITIL v4 service management processes.

Question # 88.	D. Michelle should select a virtual client that allows her to run her application in a cloud- hosted environment. This will allow the application to run in a secure location while still allowing her to access it from lower- trust devices.

Question # 89.	B. While maintaining a library of software licenses is important, it is not part of hardening practices.

Question # 90.	B. In ITIL the recovery plan includes detailed plans for returning systems and services to a working state and can also include recovering data to a known consistent state. The business continuity strategy sets the strategy for business functions. IT service continuity plans focus on how to ensure continuity during specified disasters for services and systems. Disaster recovery invocation guidelines explain how and when to invoke the DR procedures.

Question # 91.	B. For many organizations the best option to select when facing cloud forensic investigations is to engage a third party. In this case, without an internal expert and as a small company, Jason’s best bet is third- party experts.

Question # 92.	A. A facility’s geographic location influences both the requirements for things like HVAC as well as environmental threats like extreme weather. Proximity to population centers may have secondary influence on utilities or staffing, and both cost and security requirements may influence the design, but the larger impact is from its geographic location.

Question # 93.	C. Change management practices and baselines need to include methods for handling deviations in reasonable ways. That means Rick should ensure that the policy includes an assignment of tasks, including deviation notification and documentation.

Question # 94.	D. The production activities will make full use of pooled resources, so they will not be isolated unless the customer is paying for that specific characteristic of service. Provisioning, management, and access to storage should all be isolated to ensure security of those functions.

Question # 95.	B. User interaction with the cloud is not described in this phrase. Ping, power, and pipe refers to connectivity, power, and facility space with services like HVAC.

Question # 96.	A. For the purposes described in the question, a Tier 1 datacenter should suffice; it is the cheapest, and you need it only for occasional backup purposes (as opposed to constant access). The details of location and market are irrelevant and just distractors.

Question # 97.	C. The most effective way for Isaac to acquire meaningful BC/DR capabilities is to move to a cloud- hosted datacenter. This means that his organization doesn’t have to make major investments in their datacenter to add capabilities. Of course, staying with the current datacenter doesn’t meet his needs already!

Question # 98.	A. Creating and maintaining proper chain of custody documentation provides nonrepudiation for the process, ensuring that the handling will survive scrutiny at a later date. Data tampering by investigators could still occur but would be identified in a properly documented chain. Chain of custody might be required by law enforcement, but it won’t help a company engage with them, and plausible deniability is not a forensic concept.

Question # 99.	B. VLANs (virtual local area networks) are logical overlays used to segregate network devices. DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) provides a means of giving systems IP addresses and other important network information automatically when requested. VPNs (virtual private networks) are used to create secure channels between networks, typically over untrusted networks, and STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) is used to prevent loops in networks.

Question # 100.	C. Backup power does not have to be delivered by batteries; it can be fed to the datacenter through redundant utility lines or from a generator.
