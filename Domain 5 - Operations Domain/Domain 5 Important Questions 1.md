1.	What is the primary incident response goal?
A.	Remediating the incident
B.	Reverting to the last known good state
C.	Determining the scope of the possible loss
D.	Outcomes dictated by business requirements
Answer:
D. This is not an easy question; different industries and different organizations will have differing goals. Each organization will determine for itself what the primary goal of incident response will be, and this may even differ from incident to incident, depending on the nature of the incident itself (in other words, a given organization may set priorities such that the primary goal of incident response in a disaster is continuity of operations, while the goal in responding to unauthorized access may be halting data disclosure).
