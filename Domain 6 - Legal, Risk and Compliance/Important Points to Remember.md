‚ùìWhich of the following is a U.S. audit standard often used to evaluate cloud providers?
üí°The Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements **(SSAE) 18** is the current **AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants)** audit 
   standard.
‚ùìThe Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR) program has _______________ tiers.
üí°Three [ The STAR program has three tiers ]

‚ùìThe Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR) program‚Äôs tier of self-assessment is which of the following?
üí°**Tier 1 is the lowest tier of the STAR program, involving only self-assessment**. Currently, there are two levels of CSA STAR Certification: Level 1 and   
  Level 2. Level 1 is a self-assessment based on the CSA CCM, while Level 2 is a third-party assessment based on the CSA CCM and additional requirements.

What is the full form of OECD
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development

What is the function of OECD
OECD is a multinational entity that creates nonbinding policy suggestions for its member countries. And OECD has published recommendations for privacy laws.

Define what is Collection limitation principle
The collection limitation principle requires any entity that gathers personally identifiable information (PII) about a person to restrict data collection to only
information that is necessary for the transaction, and only with the knowledge and the permission of the individual.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is a multinational entity that creates nonbinding policy suggestions for its member countries. The OECD has published recommendations for privacy laws. One of the characteristics the OECD suggests that privacy laws include is the _______________.
Purpose specification principle

- PCI DSS full form is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, and it was implemented in year 2004.
- FISMA full form is Federal Information Security Management Act, and it was signed into laws in year 2002 in the United States.
- FISMA pertains to the security of federal government IT systems and outlines requirements for agency security programs.
- HIPAA stands for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, was implemented by United States in 1996.
- HIPAA provides security for the privacy and protection of personal medical records.
- SOX stands for Sarbanes-Oxley Act became law in the United States in 2002.
- SOX sets requirements for publicly traded companies and public accouting firms.
- FIPS 140-2 standards were developed by the governemnt of the United States and pertains to the certification of cryptographic modules used within systems.
- 
- 
- Safe Harbor program was designed by the US Department of Commerce as a voluntary set of regulations.
- Safe Harbor program was developed to bridge the gap in privacy regulations between two distinct and different jurisdictions; The United States and European Union.
- Safe Harbor program allow United States companies to comply with contractual and regulatory requirements necessary to doing business within EU borders.
- Compliance with regulations is considered an external audit, and it is done by an independent third party.

- SOC2 reports are composed of five (5) principles: Confidentiality, processing integrity, Availability, Privacy, and Security.
- Contract should clearly document the responsibilities and duties of each party as far as communication and compliance.
- In the event of any litigation, either against the cloud customer‚Äôs systems or services or against the cloud provider, the contract should clearly document the
  responsibilities and duties of each party as far as communication and compliance.
 - SLA specifies operational thresholds and performance metrics.
 - Remember that SLS is not an appropriate document for litigation responsibilities.
- The	first	step	with	an	internal	information	security	management	system (ISMS)	involves	defining	an	organization‚Äôs	security	policies
- After	the	formulation	of	security	policies,	the	next	step	is	to	define the	scope	of	the	ISMS	efforts,	which	will	define	and	drive	all	future activities	and
  determine	what	is	to	be	included	and	to	what	extent.
- The next step is Risk assessment and then next step is Implement Controls.
- So, basically the flow is Define an organization's security policy --> Define the scope of the ISMS --> Risk assessment --> Implement Controls.

- 14 domains of ISO 27001:2013 are;
 1. A.5 ‚Äì Information Security Policies: Management direction for information security (policies, review, communication).

 13. A.17 ‚Äì Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity Management: Disaster recovery, resilience planning, redundancy.
 14. A.18 ‚Äì **Compliance**: Meeting legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements; audits.

- **eDiscovery**	is	the	process	that	requires	**searching**,	**identifying**, **collecting**,	and	**securing	electronic	data	or	records**,	typically	to	be	used for	criminal	or	civil	legal	matters.	It	is	similar	to	the	discovery	process typically	used	for	evidence	collection	or	document	production	in	the course	of	a	legal	inquiry,	just	specifically	focused	on	electronic records	and	the	particular	needs	and	processes	required	for	them.

- When	dealing	with	possible	**eDiscovery**	in	a	cloud	environment, where	responsibilities	are	a	shared	between	the	cloud	customer	and cloud	provider,	it	is	essential	for	the	**contract**	to	outline	**responsibilities** and	the	requirements	for	their	completion,	including	time requirements.

- SOC3 report report	is	considered	for	‚Äúgeneral‚Äù	use	and	does	not	containany	sensitive	information.
- SOC	1	reports	are	designed	for	restricted	use, and	only	for	internal	staff,	current	customers,	or	auditors	on	behalf	of regulators.
- SAS-70	reports	are	actually	deprecated	at	this time,	but	even	when	in	widespread	use,	they	were	considered restricted-use	reports	and	were	similar	to	SOC	1	reports.
- SOC	2	reports,	although	more	broad	in substance	and	duration	than	SOC	1	reports,	are	still	considered ‚Äúrestricted	use‚Äù	and	not	for	public	dissemination.

- Regulated	PII	is	data	that	is	protected	via	law	or	regulation	and carries	with	it	the	enforcement	of	the	jurisdiction	governing	its	use and	protection.	Most	regulations	also	stipulate	disclosure	requirements that	an	organization	must	follow	for	the	unauthorized	or	inappropriate release	or	compromise	of	PII	information	to	the	affected	individuals.

- SOX laws	is	highly	related	to	the	preservation	and retention	of	electronic	records.
- Health	Insurance	Portability	and Accountability	Act	(HIPAA)	of	1996	pertains	to	the	protection	of patient	privacy	and	medical	records.	It	is	not	focused	on	the preservation	or	retention	of	electronic	records.
- Safe	Harbor	program	was	developed	by	the United	States	Department	of	Commerce	as	a	way	for	US	companies	to bridge	the	privacy	laws	between	the	United	States	and	the	European Union	and	comply	with	the	more	strict	requirements.
- Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley	Act	(GLBA)	of	1999 is	focused	on	how	financial	institutions	handle	the	private	information of	individuals.	It	is	not	specifically	focused	on	records	retention	or preservation.
   
- The	change	management	policies	and	practices	of	an	organization are	included	as	part	of	the	security	principle	of	the	SOC	2	report.	The change	management	principle	pertains	to	how	an	organization determines	what	changes	are	needed	as	well	as	how	they	are approved,	implemented,	tested,	and	verified.	The	goal	is	to	ensure	that all	changes	are	done	in	a	methodical	and	controlled	manner,	with appropriate	approvals	and	safeguards	to	prevent	unauthorized changes.

- Remediation is NOT	one	of	the	steps	involved	in	the	audit plan.

- ISO/IEC	27018	standards,	audits	should	be	completed	by an	independent	entity	that	does	not	have	any	financial	or	management stake	in	the	organization	or	application,	and	should	be	done	at	least yearly.
- ISO/IEC	27018	was	developed	to	establish	standards	for	privacy involving	cloud	computing.

- During	the	**defining	objectives	stage	of	an	audit**,	the	**policies	and regulations**	to	be	audited	against	are	determined,	as	well	as	the	**risk acceptance	of	the	organization**	in	regard	to	them.	As	part	of	this process,	the	**number	of	staff**	needed	to	complete	the	audit	is determined,	both	on	the	part	of	the	auditors	and	on	the	organization being	audited.
- defining	the	**scope**	of	the	audit	**occurs	after	the defining	of	objectives**.

- The	United	States	lacks	an	overall	comprehensive	privacy regulation	for	data	protection.	Although	various	regulations	pertain	to specific	types	of	data	or	institutions,	there	is	no	single,	comprehensive regulation	for	personal	information	or	privacy	protection.
- European	Union	has	long	been	one	of	the top	drivers	of	data	privacy	and	personal	protection.	It	issued	Directive 95/45	EC	in	1995,	which	established	data	privacy	as	a	human	right.
- Russia	put	into	effect	Russian	Law	526-FZ	in 2015,	which	requires	all	data	and	processing	for	personal	information on	Russian	citizens	to	be	done	by	systems	and	applications	that physically	reside	and	are	hosted	within	the	borders	of	the	Russian Federation.
- "cost" is	NOT something	that	would	be	found	in	an	audit	scope	statement.
- The	costs	of	the	audit	are	not	something	that	is	included	in	an	audit scope	statement.	They	would	be	determined	by	contract	separately. Although	the	intended	scope	of	the	audit	will	likely	have	an	impact	on costs,	they	are	not	included	in	the	audit	scope	statement.
