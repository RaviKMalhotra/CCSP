ANSWERS

### Comprehensive	Answers	and	Explanations

### Question # 1 - Which	of	the	following	pieces	of	data	about	an	individual	would	be considered	a	direct	identifier?     
A.	Job	title    
B.	Educational	history    
C.	Income    
D.	Phone	number     

Answer: D.	   

A	phone	number	is	considered	a	direct	identifier	because	it	is unique	to	a	residence	or	individual.	With	a	phone	number	as	a	sole piece	of	information,	a	specific	individual	can	be	readily	and	quickly identified,	meeting	the	precise	definition	of	a	direct	identifier.

A	is	incorrect	because	a	job	title	is	not	specific	enough	to	identify	an individual	in	almost	all	circumstances.	With	most	job	titles,	unless attached	to	a	specific	organization,	the	description	could	easily	apply to	a	large	number	of	individuals	and	therefore	cannot	be	tied	directly to	a	specific	person.

B	is	incorrect	because	educational	history,	including	schools	attended and	degrees	conferred,	would	not	be	specific	enough	to	tie	to	an individual	and	would	apply	to	a	large	number	of	possible	people. Therefore,	it	would	not	be	considered	a	direct	identifier.

C	is	incorrect	because	income	would	be	a	seemingly	arbitrary	number that	could	apply	to	a	very	large	number	of	jobs	and	individuals	and therefore,	by	itself,	would	not	be	a	direct	identifier	to	a	specific individual.

### Question # 2 - When	DLP	is	used	to	protect	data	in	use,	where	would	the	DLP	solutionand	software	be	deployed?     
A.	On	the	client    
B.	On	the	application	server    
C.	Network	perimeter    
D.	Data	layer     

Answer: A.	

For	a	DLP	solution	to	work	for	data	in	use,	it	would	need	to	be installed	on	the	actual	client	where	the	processing	was	taking	place. This	could	be	anything	from	a	mobile	device	to	a	desktop	computer, laptop,	or	software	client.	By	being	installed	at	the	client	level,	the DLP	solution	would	be	able	to	closely	watch	how	the	data	was	being used	and	processed	and	to	apply	policies	appropriately.

B	is	incorrect	because	the	application	server	is	under	control	of	the organization	and	the	data	owner,	so	how	it	is	used	can	be	tightly controlled.	When	on	a	client,	a	user	has	a	broad	range	of	things	he	can do	with	the	data,	but	an	application	server	will	be	limited	to	what	it	is programmed	to	do	and	is	controlled	by	the	application	owner.

C	is	incorrect	because	installing	DLP	at	the	network	perimeter	would be	appropriate	for	controlling	and	monitoring	data	in	transit,	not	data in	use,	as	there	is	no	processing	or	use	of	the	data	at	the	network perimeter	level.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	data	layer	is	where	data	at	rest	would	be applicable,	not	where	the	data	is	being	actually	used	or	consumed	as	it would	be	on	a	client.

### Question # 3 - Which	cloud	storage	type	uses	an	opaque	value	or	descriptor	to	categorizeand	organize	data?    
A.	Volume    
B.	Object    
C.	Structured    
D.	Unstructured     

Answer: B.	

Object	storage	works	by	utilizing	a	flat	file	system,	where	each	item is	housed	with	an	opaque	handler	or	descriptor.	When	files	are accessed,	the	object	storage	is	called	with	the	descriptor	or	opaque value	and	then	presented	to	the	application	or	client.

A	is	incorrect	because	volume	storage	provisions	a	logical	storage container	to	the	virtual	machine,	where	it	is	then	utilized	much	as	a traditional	file	system,	with	directory	structures	and	file-naming conventions	chosen	by	the	application	developers	or	administrators, rather	than	through	the	use	of	an	opaque	value.

C	is	incorrect	because	structured	storage,	used	with	PaaS,	resembles database	storage,	where	items	are	categorized	in	a	logical	and consistent	manner.

D	is	incorrect	because	unstructured	storage	is	used	with	PaaS	and	is employed	to	store	files	and	objects	that	do	not	fit	within	the	structured storage	type—typically,	support	files	or	web	files	such	as	images, style	sheets,	and	so	on.

### [important] Question # 4 - Although	content	analysis	is	the	least	efficient	and	slowest	of	the	available data	discovery	methods,	which	of	the	following	aspects	of	the	data	make discovery	the	most	challenging?     
A.	Size    
B.	Throughput    
C.	Quality    
D. Source     

Answer: C.	

**With	any	content	analysis,	the	quality	of	the	data	poses	the	biggest challenge	to	data	discovery**.	
Content	can	be	free form	and	may	come	in a	variety	of	formats,	with	little	to	no	consistency.	Variations	in spelling	and	word	use	can	also	make	content	analysis	very	challenging because	there	is	no	standardization	to	build	concrete	discovery	rules against.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	size	of	the	data	by	itself	does	not	pose	any direct	challenges	to	data	discovery.	Although	large	data	sets	will require	more	time	or	processing	to	evaluate,	the	size	does	not	correlate necessarily	to	the	quality	problems	that	do	pose	a	significant challenge.

B	is	incorrect	because	throughput	may	impact	performance	and processing	time	but	does	not	pose	the	type	of	challenge	in	the evaluation	of	content	that	quality	does.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	source	of	the	data	has	no	direct	bearing	on the	quality	of	data	or	the	ability	to	evaluate	it.

### Question # 5 - Which	of	the	following	actions	do	NOT	fall	under	the	“create”	phase	of the	cloud	data	lifecycle?     
A.	Newly	created	data    
B.	Data	that	is	imported    
C.	Data	that	is	archived     
D.	Data	that	is	modified     

Answer: C.	   

Data	that	is	archived	involves	taking	already	existing	data	and capturing	a	read-only	static	copy	of	it	for	long-term	preservation. Although	the	data	may	be	new	to	a	particular	storage	medium, especially	if	it’s	archived	on	a	system	external	from	its	original location,	the	format	or	content	of	the	data	is	not	changed	during	the process,	and	as	such	it’s	not	newly	created	or	modified	data.

A	is	incorrect	because	newly	created	data	is	the	main	and	simplest focus	of	the	create	phase	of	the	cloud	data	lifecycle.

B	is	incorrect	because	data	that	is	imported	is	new	to	the	system accepting	the	import.	Because	it	is	new	to	the	system	importing	it,	the data	is	effectively	being	created	on	that	system	and	entered	into	its storage	and	classifications.	This	differs	from	archiving	because importing	implies	future	use	and	processing	of	the	data,	rather	than capturing	a	static	copy.

D	is	incorrect	because	data	that	is	modified	is	considered	new	data	due to	its	new	form	or	format,	so	it	has	been	created	as	part	of	the	initial phase	within	the	system.

### Question # 6 - You	are	working	as	a	forensic	investigator	and	collecting	information	on	a potential	system	breach	by	a	malicious	insider.	Which	of	the	following	is essential	for	you	in	order	to	ensure	evidence	is	preserved	and	admissible?    
A.	Confidentiality    
B.	Privacy    
C.	Chain	of	custody    
D.	Aggregation    
Answer: C.	   

In	order	for	evidence	to	be	considered	properly	preserved	and admissible	for	legal	proceedings,	the	chain	of	custody	is	essential.	The chain	of	custody	catalogs	the	life	of	the	data,	including	its	capture, being	passed	through	various	parties,	any	modifications	or	tests	run against	it,	and	any	other	information	pertinent	to	everything	and everyone	who	has	touched	it	or	accessed	it.	The	chain	of	custody serves	to	preserve	confidence	in	the	data,	as	well	as	giving	the	ability to	question	or	challenge	it	based	on	its	handling	and	preservation.
 
 A	is	incorrect	because	confidentiality	is	not	important	for	all	data	as part	of	its	preservation.	Obviously,	some	data	that	is	sensitive	has confidentiality	requirements,	but	those	are	separate	from	the requirements	of	chain	of	custody	to	catalog	the	handling	of	data	since its	collection.
 
 B	is	incorrect	for	the	same	reason	as	confidentiality,	in	that	privacy does	not	apply	to	all	data	and	does	not	preserve	its	handling	processes or	procedures.
 
 D	is	incorrect	because	aggregation	refers	to	collecting	data,	typically event	data,	into	a	single	index	and	storage	system.	Aggregation	does not	apply	directly	to	data	preservation	at	all.

### Question # 7 - Which	storage	type	is	typically	used	by	the	cloud	provider	to	house	virtual machine	images?    
A.	Volume    
B.	Structured    
C.	Unstructured   
D. Object      

Answer: D.	    

Object	storage	utilizes	a	flat	hierarchy	and	catalogs	data	with	an opaque	file	handler	or	descriptor.	When	storing	virtual	machine images,	cloud	providers	typically	use	object	storage	because	there	is no	reason	to	maintain	an	organized	file	structure,	and	an	opaque descriptor	works	perfectly	for	virtual	machine	images	and	provides easy	access	to	call	them.

A	is	incorrect	because	volume	storage	resembles	a	traditional	file system	structure,	with	organization	and	filenames,	and	would	not serve	an	appropriate	or	necessary	purpose	for	the	storage	of	virtual machine	imagines.	Volume	storage	also	is	logically	attached	to	a specific	instance	and	would	not	be	broadly	accessible	throughout	and environment	like	object	storage	is.

B	is	incorrect	because	structured	storage	resembles	a	database-type organization	and	is	used	specifically	with	PaaS	implementations;	it would	not	be	used	for	virtual	image	storage	throughout	a	cloud infrastructure.

C	is	incorrect	because	unstructured	storage	is	used	within	a	PaaS implementation	for	support	objects	such	as	images	and	web	files;	it would	not	be	used	for	the	storage	of	virtual	machines	for	use throughout	a	cloud	infrastructure.

### [important] Question # 8 - When	a	DLP	solution	is	used	to	protect	[data	in	transit],	where	is	the optimal	place	to	deploy	the	DLP	components?    
A.	On	the	server	originating	the	traffic    
B.	At	the	network	perimeter    
C.	Between	VLANs     
D.	On	the	server	receiving	the	data     

Answer: B.	

When	protecting	data	in	transit,	a	DLP	solution	would	optimally	be deployed	at	the	network	perimeter.	Within	a	network,	extensive monitoring	can	be	used	in	conjunction	with	other	security	controls	on the	data,	but	the	network	perimeter	represents	the	last	hop	before leaving	the	application	for	external	use,	and	would	be	the	appropriate place	to	have	a	DLP	implementation.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	server	originating	the	traffic	represents	a first	hop	of	network	transmission,	and	the	data	may	pass	through	other systems	and	network	devices	before	leaving	for	external	use.	It	would
not	be	the	optimal	place	for	a	DLP	implementation.

C	is	incorrect	because	firewalls	and	other	network-monitoring solutions	are	used	between	VLANs,	which	by	nature	are	internal	to	a network	and	do	not	represent	when	data	leaves	for	external	use.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	server	receiving	the	data	would	be	a	client where	data	in	use	becomes	the	appropriate	stage;	it	is	no	longer	data	in transit	once	it	reaches	its	destination.

### Question # 9 - Which	of	the	following	types	of	solutions	is	often	used	for	regulatory compliance	reporting?    
A.	SIEM    
B.	DLP    
C.	IRM    
D.	IDS    

Answer: A.	   

A	security	information	and	event	management	(SIEM)	solution	is used	to	collect,	aggregate,	and	process	event	data	throughout	an application	or	even	an	entire	infrastructure.	
It	is	often	used	to	produce auditing	and	compliance	reports	based	on	the	data	that	is	collected	and aggregated,	and	most	SIEM	solutions	have	very	robust	reporting, alerting,	and	dashboard	capabilities.

B	is	incorrect	because	a	data	loss	prevention	(DLP)	solution	is	used	to protect	sensitive	information	and	how	it	is	processed,	handled,	and disseminated.	It	is	not	used	for	reporting.

C	is	incorrect	because	information	rights	management	(IRM)	solutions are	used	to	control	how	information	is	accessed	and	used,	and	is	not	a reporting	tool	or	solution.

D	is	incorrect	because	an	intrusion	detection	system	(IDS)	is	used	to monitor	data	transmissions	against	known	signatures	and	patterns,	and to	alert	application	owners	or	developers	to	anomalies	or	suspicious circumstances.	It	is	not	used	for	regulatory	or	compliance	reporting.

### Question # 10 - Encryption	solutions	can	be	embedded	within	database	operations	that will	serve	to	protect	data	in	a	manner	that	is	not	noticeable	to	the	user. What	kind	of	encryption	strategy	is	this?     
A.	Transparent     
B.	Passive     
C.	RSA    
D. Homomorphic    

Answer: A.	

**Transparent	encryption	is	used	within	a	database	to	protect	data	as it	is	being	stored	and	processed,	but	it’s	done	as	an	integrated	database function	and	is	not	something	that	needs	input	from	the	application.**
**The	application	doesn’t	even	need	to	be	aware	it	is	being	done**. Transparent	encryption	is	an	effective	tool	because	applications	do	not need	to	be	rewritten	or	modified	to	handle	encryption	activities.

B	is	incorrect	because	passive	encryption	is	not	a	method	of embedding	encryption	within	a	database	system	and	its	operations.

C	is	incorrect	because	RSA	refers	to	a	specific	type	of	encryption algorithm,	not	to	a	specific	implementation	of	encryption.	A transparent	encryption	system	may	use	RSA	as	its	cryptographic algorithm,	but	RSA	itself	is	not	applicable	to	the	question.

D	is	incorrect	because	homomorphic	encryption	is	a	cutting-edge technique	that	allows	for	accessing	and	processing	encrypted	data without	the	traditional	step	of	having	to	unencrypt	it	first.	It	is	a	type of	encryption	rather	than	a	specific	implementation,	which	is	what	the question	is	asking.

### Question # 11 - Which	phase	of	the	cloud	data	lifecycle	also	typically	entails	the	process of	data	classification?     
A.	Use    
B.	Store    
C.	Create    
D.	Archive    

Answer: C.	   

Data	classification	should	optimally	be	done	immediately	as	part	of the	“create”	phase.	As	soon	as	data	is	created,	it	is	subjected	to regulatory	and	other	protection	requirements,	so	classification	must	be applied	immediately.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	“use”	phase	is	where	data	is	first	consumed and	processed;	however,	because	the	data	has	already	been	stored, classification	needs	to	have	already	been	applied.	In	some	instances, the	“store”	phase	may	be	momentary,	and	in	others	the	data	may reside	in	storage	for	a	while	before	entering	the	“use”	phase,	so classification	is	needed	earlier.

B	is	incorrect	because	data	needs	to	have	a	classification	attached before	it	enters	the	“store”	phase,	as	many	security	controls	are implemented	based	on	the	way	data	is	stored	and	protected.	The manner	in	which	the	data	is	stored	may	also	be	highly	dependent	on its	classification.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	“archive”	phase	is	a	much	later	part	of	the overall	process,	and	data	will	have	gone	through	storage,	usage,	and sharing	long	before	it	reaches	archiving,	so	classification	would	need to	take	place	much	earlier.

### [important] Question # 12 - Your	application	generates	large	volumes	of	data	based	on	customer	input. With	the	large	volume	of	incoming	data,	you	need	to	be	able	to	determine data	discovery	and	classification	as	quickly	and	efficiently	as	possible. Which	of	the	[following	methods	for	data	discovery]	would	be	your	best choice?     
A.	Content	analysis    
B.	Labels     
C.	Metadata    
D.	Authorization     

Answer: C.	    

**Metadata	uses	attributes	about	the	data	itself,	such	as	creator, application,	type,	data,	or	any	other	type	of	information	to	determine classification.	Metadata	is	typically	known	as	“data	about	data.”	By using	metadata,	where	possible,	you	can	make	very	quick	and	efficient determinations	on	classification.**

A	is	incorrect	because	content	analysis	is	a	very	intensive	and	slow process	for	analyzing	data	to	determine	classification.	It	is	also	highly subjective	because	the	data	may	not	be	normalized	and	consistent enough	to	accurately	determine	classification	with	any	type	of efficiency.

B	is	incorrect	because	applying	labels,	although	much	quicker	than content	analysis,	is	highly	subjective	and	is	often	done	inconsistently. Labels	rely	on	a	process	or	require	users	to	correctly	apply	them	in	a consistent	manner,	whereas	metadata	uses	attributes	about	the	data itself.

D	is	incorrect	because	authorization	is	the	process	of	granting privileges	and	access	to	data	or	functions	within	an	application;	it	is not	related	to	the	classification	process	at	all.

### [important] Question # 13 - When	using	an	e-commerce	site,	you	see	your	credit	card	information with	all	but	the	last	four	digits	replaced	with	asterisks.	What	kind	of	data masking	is	being	employed	by	the	application?    
A.	Dynamic    
B.	Homomorphic     
C.	Static    
D.	Replication  

Answer: A.	    

[important] **Dynamic	masking	is	implemented	between	the	data	and	application layers**,	
and	is	**applied	in	real	time**	**as	data	is	requested	and	processed**. 
**This	allows	for	showing	only	portions	of	a	credit	card	number**,	for example,	rather	than	the	entire	number	that	is	contained	in	storage.

B	is	incorrect	because	homomorphic	refers	to	a	type	of	cutting-edge encryption	where	data	can	be	accessed	and	utilized	without	the traditional	need	to	unencrypt	the	data	set	first.	Although	systems	may use	homomorphic	encryption	throughout	any	type	of	process,	it	does not	specifically	relate	to	masking.

C	is	incorrect	because	**static	masking	creates	a	set	of	data,	typically used	for	testing	in	non-production	environments**.	
**It	is	done	as	a separate	process	and	outputs	a	distinct	set	of	new	data	with	masked values**,	
**and	it’s	not	done	on	a	live	system	such	as	the	one	presented	in the	question.**

D	is	incorrect	because	replication	refers	to	making	multiple	copies	of data	for	either	redundancy,	high	availability,	or	any	use	where	a secondary	copy	is	needed.	It	is	not	related	specifically	to	masking,	as replication	involves	making	identical	copies	of	data	and	not	outputting one	with	masking	in	place.

### [important] Question # 14 - During	which	phase	of	the	cloud	data	lifecycle	would	technologies	such as	DRM	and	DLP	be	most	appropriately	utilized?    
A.	Use    
B.	Share    
C.	Store     
D.	Archive    

Answer: B.	   

[important] **During	the	“share”	phase,	data	is	allowed	outside	of	the	original system	and	consumed	by	external	users	or	services.	This	point,	where data	is	leaving	systems	and	consumed	by	others,	is	ideal	for	the inclusion	of	DRM	and	DLP	technologies	to	control	how	data	is disseminated	and	ultimately	used,	as	well	as	to	control	how	far	and wide	it	can	be	distributed**.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	“use”	phase	is	still	within	a	controlled application	and	environment,	where	more	stringent	controls	can	be applied	without	relying	on	services	and	technologies	such	as	DRM and	DLP.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	“store”	phase	relies	on	different technologies	for	security,	such	as	server	controls,	network	controls, and	encryption.	DRM	and	DLP	are	focused	on	where	data	is transmitted	or	consumed	and	would	be	more	appropriate	during	the “share”	phase.

D	is	incorrect	because	archiving	involves	static	copies	of	data	for preservation,	where	technologies	such	as	encryption	would	be appropriate.	The	use	of	DRM	or	DLP	would	not	be	necessary	or appropriate	because	the	data	is	not	being	transmitted,	shared,	or consumed	in	this	phase.

### Question # 15 - In	order	to	move	quickly	from	your	traditional	data	center	to	a	cloud environment,	you	want	your	[storage	to	resemble	the	same	directory structure]	you	currently	have.	Which	cloud	storage	type	will	be	your	best option?     
A.	Object    
B.	Structured      
C.	Volume     
D.	Unstructured    

Answer: C.	     

**Volume	storage,	used	with	Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS),	is	a logical	storage	volume	that	is	mounted	and	used	much	like	a traditional	file	system	on	a	virtual	machine**.	
It	allows	for	directory structures	and	naming	conventions,	the	same	as	a	legacy	system, along	with	the	same	kind	of	file	permissions	and	controls.	It	would make	for	the	easiest	and	quickest	transition	for	a	system	or	application to	a	cloud	environment.

A	is	incorrect	because	object	storage	is	an	external	storage	system	that uses	an	opaque	file	handler	or	descriptor	to	catalog	and	access	items. It	does	not	resemble	a	traditional	directory	structure	and	would	not	be applicable	to	this	type	of	situation.

B	is	incorrect	because	structured	storage,	used	with	Platform	as	a Service	(PaaS),	typically	is	a	database-type	system,	which	does	not use	file	system	organization	or	structure	in	a	traditional	server	sense.

D	is	incorrect	because	unstructured	is	a	data	storage	type	with	PaaS that	is	used	for	objects	that	do	not	fit	within	a	structured	storage system	(typically,	support	files,	images,	web	objects,	and	so	on).	It	is not	used	in	the	sense	of	a	traditional	file	system’s	structure	and configuration	for	this	example.

### [important] Question # 16 - Which	of	the	following	concepts	refers	to	[having	logs	available	from throughout	a	system	or	application	within	a]	single	source?    
A.	Consolidation     
B.	Correlation     
C.	Aggregation     
D.	Archiving    
Answer: C.	     

[important] **Aggregation	refers	to	the	collection	of	event	data	and	logs	from throughout	an	environment	and	indexing	them	into	a	single	source.**	
**It allows	for	quick	and	easy	searching	of	events	for	trends	of	specific incidents	across	all	systems,	rather	than	having	to	go	onto	each individual	system.**

A	is	incorrect	because	although	**consolidation	is	essentially	the	same concept	as	aggregation,	the	official	term	is	aggregation**.

[important] B	is	incorrect	because	**correlation	is	the	function	of	taking	different data	sources	and	finding	commonalities	or	trends	among	them**. Although	this	is	typically	done	after	aggregation,	these	are	two separate	and	distinct	concepts.

D	is	incorrect	because	archiving	is	the	long-term	preservation	of	event data.	This	is	often	done	on	systems	that	do	aggregation	for	simplicity; these	concepts	are	not	necessarily	related	or	dependent	upon	each other.

### Question # 17 - Which	key	storage	solution	would	be	the	BEST	choice	in	a	situation where	availability	might	be	of	a	particular	concern?    
A.	Internal    
B.	External     
C.	Hosted     
D.	Embedded    

Answer: A.	    

**Internal	key	storage	keeps	the	keys	on	the	actual	server	or	system where	they	are	to	be	used**.	
Although	this	will	prevent	the	availability problems	that	an	external	key	store	may	experience,	**it	also	makes security	more	challenging**.	
**If	the	server	or	system	itself	is compromised	in	a	way	where	a	malicious	actor	gains	system	access, he	can	also	access	the	keys	used	to	encrypt	and	protect	the	data	on	the system.**

B	is	incorrect	because	an	external	key	system,	although	more	secure	in the	case	of	a	system	breach,	also	carries	with	it	the	potential	problems of	availability.	If	network	access	to	the	external	key	store	becomes unavailable,	or	if	the	external	system	experiences	an	outage,	then	the data	will	become	inaccessible	until	access	and	availability	are restored.

C	is	incorrect	because	“hosted”	is	not	a	term	typically	applied	to	a	key storage	solution.	In	essence,	all	key	systems	are	hosted;	it	is	the delineation	between	internal	and	external	that	is	important.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	term	“embedded”	refers	to	a	type	of encryption,	not	to	a	type	of	key	storage	system.	The	term	is	typically applied	to	encryption	that	is	built	into	a	system	and	is	an	integral	part of	it,	rather	than	an	external	service	or	operation.

### [important tricky] Question # 18 - Digital	right	management	is	an	extension	of	information	rights management,	but	is	focused	on	which	particular	type	of	data?    
A.	Health	records    
B.	Academic	records    
C.	Consumer	media     
D.	Financial	data    

Answer: C.	    

Digital	rights	management	(DRM)	systems	are	similar	to	IRM solutions,	**with	the	main	distinction	being	their	focus	on	consumer media**.	
**They	are	intended	to	protect	copyrights	and	the	use	of	digital media	after	it	is	distributed**.	
**DRM	systems	can	be	used	to	prevent copying,	enforce	expirations	of	subscriptions,	control	what	devices may	be	used	to	access	the	media,	and	many	other	types	of	operations**.

A	is	incorrect	because	**health	records	are	not	a	focus	of	DRM**,	although IRM	solutions	may	be	used	to	protect	the	data	according	to	its	specific regulations	or	requirements.

B	is	incorrect	because	**academic	records	are	not	a	focus	of	DRM** solutions,	although	IRM	solutions	may	be	used	to	protect	the	data	as necessary.

D	is	incorrect	because	**DRM	is	focused	on	consumer	media	and	not financial	records**,	although	IRM	solutions	may	be	used	to	protect financial	records,	as	applicable.

### Question # 19 - Which	of	the	following	is	a	law	in	the	United	States	that	protects healthcare	information	and	privacy?    
A.	HIPAA    
B.	PII     
C.	PHI    
D.	ACA     

Answer: A.	    

The	Health	Insurance	Portability	and	Accountability	Act	**(HIPAA) is	a	United	States	law**	that	is	focused	on	health	records,	their protection,	disclosure	requirements,	and	how	health	records	may	be used	or	shared.

B	is	incorrect	because	PII	refers	to	personally	identifiable	information as	a	broad	concept,	rather	than	a	specific	law	or	regulation.	The concepts	of	PII	do	certainly	pertain	to	health	records	and	their protection,	though.

C	is	incorrect	because	PHI	refers	to	protected	health	information.	It	is a	subset	and	section	of	the	HIPAA	law	and	defines	what	types	of information	must	be	protected.	In	other	words,	it’s	only	a	portion	of the	applicable	law	and	now	the	law	itself.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	Affordable	Care	Act	(ACA)	is	a	United States	law	pertaining	to	health	insurance	coverage	and	access,	but	it does	not	pertain	to	specific	regulations	for	the	handling	and	protection of	heathcare	data.

### [important] Question # 20 - Which	of	the	following	technologies	or	concepts	could	be	used	for	the [preservation	of	integrity]?     
A.	DNSSEC     
B.	Encryption     
C.	Tokenization     
D.	Anonymization      

Answer: A.	

[important] **DNSSEC	is	an	extension	on	the	traditional	DNS	protocol	and allows	for	the	signing	and	verification	of	DNS	results**.	
[important] **When	a	query is	issued	to	the	DNS	servers,	they	sign	the	results	using	keys	that	can authenticate	that	they	did	come	from	an	authoritative	source**.	
**This strategy	prevents	DNS	spoofing	and	redirecting	attacks,	and	is implemented	in	a	way	that	does	not	require	additional	lookups	or calls**.

B	is	incorrect	because	**encryption	is	used	for	preserving	and	protecting the	confidentiality	of	data**,	but	not	for	the	integrity	of	it.	There	is nothing	about	encryption	that	would	prevent	the	data	from	being altered	against	the	encrypted	blocks,	even	if	it	renders	the	data unreadable	or	unable	to	be	unencrypted.

C	is	incorrect	because	**tokenization	is	the	process	of	replacing	sensitive data	with	key	or	opaque	values	that	ultimately	can	be	mapped	back	to the	original	values**.	It	is	used	for	protecting	the	confidentiality	of	data, not	the	integrity	of	it.

D	is	incorrect	because	anonymization	is	the	process	of	removing identifiers	from	a	data	set	that	would	allow	an	individual	identity	to	be determined	from	the	various	data.	It	is	a	method	and	strategy	for protecting	the	privacy	and	confidentiality	of	data,	not	the	integrity	of it.

### [important] Question # 21 - Although	indirect	identifiers	cannot	alone	point	to	an	individual,	the	more of	them	known	can	lead	to	a	specific	identity.	Which	strategy	can	be	used to	avoid	such	a	connection	being	made?     
A.	Masking    
B.	Anonymization    
C.	Obfuscation     
D.	Encryption    

Answer: B.	    

[important] **Anonymization	is	the	process	of	removing	identifiers	that	could ultimately	be	used	to	identity	a	specific	individual**.	
This	process	can include	removing	direct	identifiers	or	a	sufficient	quantity	of	indirect identifiers	in	order	to	ensure	a	specific	identification	cannot	be	made.

A	is	incorrect	because	masking	is	the	process	of	replacing	values	in	a data	field,	or	additional	characters	can	be	added	to	alter	the	original values.	This	process	can	also	be	done	by	shifting	values	through predefined	algorithms	or	deleting	specific	data	fields	or	data	sets altogether.

C	is	incorrect	because	obfuscation	is	the	process	of	replacing	values	in
a	data	set,	typically	for	producing	sets	to	test	applications	in	nonproduction	and	development	environments.	This	is	often	done	to	meet regulatory	compliance	for	test	data.

D	is	incorrect	because	encryption	is	used	for	protecting	the confidentiality	of	data,	not	for	altering	values	or	ensuring	the	data cannot	be	tied	through	indirect	identifiers	to	a	specific	individual.

### [important] Question # 22 - Which	type	of	cloud-based	storage	is	IRM	typically	associated	with?     
A.	Volume    
B.	Unstructured    
C.	Structured     
D.	Object     

Answer: D.	    

**Object	storage	is	typical	by	used	for	data	objects	and	downloads,	to which	IRM	technologies	and	strategies	are	often	applied**.	
Other	types of	data	are	usually	either	too	scattered	and	distributed	across	many files	or	used	too	internally	to	an	application	to	really	apply	IRM	to them.	Object	storage	is	ideal	for	IRM	implementations	because	each object	represents	a	single	data	package.

A	is	incorrect	because	volume	storage	appears	as	a	traditional	file system	and	would	not	typically	represent	the	kind	of	data	that	is extracted	or	downloaded,	although	it	could	be.	Most	cloud applications	that	implement	IRM	and	offer	that	type	of	service	defer to	object	storage,	which	is	the	more	appropriate	and	correct	answer here.

B	is	incorrect	because	unstructured	data	is	used	within	PaaS implementations,	typically	for	support	files	or	media	needed	by	an application.	It	is	not	typically	used	for	the	type	of	data	that	would	be extracted	and	consumed	by	an	entity	where	the	application	of	IRM would	be	useful	or	warranted.

C	is	incorrect	because	structured	data,	used	within	PaaS,	represents	the type	of	data	that	is	typically	housed	with	a	database	system.	It	is	used for	the	processing	and	support	of	the	application,	rather	than	the	type of	data	that	would	be	extracted	or	saved	by	a	user	or	other	entity. Therefore,	the	application	of	IRM	would	not	be	applicable	or	useful.

### Question # 23 - Which	of	the	following	is	the	sole	responsibility	of	the	cloud	customer within	an	IaaS	service	category?     
A.	Physical	security    
B.	Network	security    
C.	Hypervisor	security     
D.	Data	security     

Answer: D.	

**Within	an	IaaS	implementation—and,	in	fact,	with	virtually	all cloud	hosting—data	security	is	always	the	responsibility	of	the	cloud customer**.	
Cloud	customers	are	responsible	for	ensuring	that	adequate controls	and	oversight	are	in	place,	either	by	implementing	them themselves	or	through	the	use	of	contracts	and	SLAs	to	meet	any policy	or	regulatory	requirements.

A	is	incorrect	because	physical	security	in	all	cloud	service	categories is	always	the	responsibility	of	the	cloud	provider.	The	cloud	provider is	the	only	entity	that	has	physical	access	to	facilities—there	is	no reason	for	a	cloud	customer	or	user	to	even	know	or	care	where	the provider	is	located.	Although	the	cloud	provider	may	make	available to	current	and	potential	customers	certain	reports,	specifications,	or audits	of	physical	security	for	regulatory	compliance	or	to	instill	trust, it	is	extremely	unlikely	that	much	insight	would	ever	be	gained	by cloud	customers	or	that	they	would	be	allowed	much	input.

B	is	incorrect	because	network	security	at	the	IaaS	level	is	shared between	the	cloud	customer	and	the	cloud	provider.	With	IaaS,	the cloud	customer	handles	much	of	network	security	through	the deployment	and	configuration	of	virtualized	network	devices	and	the design	of	strategies	such	as	VLAN	implementation.	The	responsibility is	ultimately	shared	with	the	cloud	provider	for	border	security	and physical	network	security.

C	is	incorrect	because	with	all	cloud	service	categories,	hypervisor security	is	solely	the	responsibility	of	the	cloud	provider.	At	the hypervisor	level,	the	cloud	customer	would	never	be	allowed	access	or given	insight	beyond	limited	API	and	service	calls	made	to	the hypervisors	via	automated	and	secured	tools	authorized	by	the	cloud provider.

### Question # 24 - Your	new	project	and	its	data	have	regulations	that	dictate	what	type	of records	must	be	maintained	and	for	how	long.	Which	term	refers	to	this concept?     
A.	Data	retention    
B.	Data	archiving    
C.	Data	preservation     
D.	Data	warehousing     

Answer: A.	

**Data	retention	is	the	process	of	collecting,	protecting,	and	storing records	for	a	defined	period	of	time**.	The	exact	duration	of	time	will be	established	by	either	regulation	or	organizational	policy,	but	the requirements	from	regulation	will	always	form	the	basis	for	the minimum	duration.

B	is	incorrect	because	although	the	term	“data	archiving”	is	very similar	to	“data	retention,”	it’s	not	the	official	term.	Archiving	is	a process	that	is	part	of	data	retention,	but	it’s	focused	on	the	technical aspects,	as	opposed	to	the	entire	approach	with	management,	policy, and	regulation	attached.

C	is	incorrect	because	data	preservation	is	only	a	part	of	an	overall data	retention	program.	Preservation	includes	the	identification	and collection	of	events	and	data.	It	culminates	in	the	actual	preservation of	the	data,	but	does	not	include	the	regulatory	and	policy considerations	that	data	retention	encompasses.

D	is	incorrect	because	data	warehousing	refers	to	the	process	of consolidating	and	storing	data	in	a	centralized	system,	which	can	then be	leveraged	for	business	intelligence	and	other	analysis.	It	does	not refer	to	the	long-term	retention	of	data,	nor	the	policies	and regulations	involved	in	it.

### Question # 25 - Which	type	of	new	and	emerging	encryption	allows	for	the	manipulation and	accessing	of	data	without	having	to	unencrypt	it	first?    
A.	Dynamic    
B.	Homomorphic     
C.	Parallel     
D.	Heterogeneous      

Answer: B.	

Homomorphic	encryption	is	a	new,	cutting-edge	method	that	allows data	to	be	accessed	and	processed	without	being	unencrypted	first.	It allows	operations	to	be	performed	against	encrypted	text,	with	the results	directly	generated	in	encrypted	form.	Unencrypting	the resulting	output	will	show	the	same	results	as	if	the	data	had	been unencrypted	when	processed.

A	is	incorrect	because	dynamic	encryption	involves	the	use	of	a cryptographic	proxy.	This	is	done	because	many	systems	where encryption	is	done,	such	as	on	personal	computers,	are	not	considered trusted	environments	where	the	encryption	modules	and	processes	are guaranteed	to	be	safe,	so	the	use	of	an	external	encryption	proxy	is intended	to	alleviate	this	problem.

C	is	incorrect	because	parallel	refers	to	multiple	processes	taking	place simultaneously.	This	can	involve	encryption	and	decryption,	or operations	such	as	uploading	and	encrypting	can	be	paired	to	occur	at the	same	time.	It	does	not	refer	to	accessing	or	manipulating	data without	the	need	to	decrypt	it	first.

D	is	incorrect	because	heterogeneous	encryption	is	not	a	real technology	or	concept.	This	option	was	merely	provided	as	a	choice similar	to	homomorphic	encryption.

### Question # 26 - Which	concept	refers	to	the	ability	to	confirm	and	validate	the	original source	of	data	or	an	operation	to	sufficiently	meet	the	required	level	of assurance?    
A.	Nonrepudiation        
B.	Integrity        
C.	Authentication        
D.	Availability      

Answer: A.	

**Nonrepudiation	is	essentially	the	assurance	and	guarantee	that something	cannot	be	denied.**	
**This	concept	is	applied	to	security	and data	in	that	the	originating	system	or	user	cannot	deny	the	validity	or authenticity	of	data	or	transactions,	thus	guaranteeing	a	high	level	of assurance**.	
This	is	of	particular	interest	in	digital	forensics	and	the preservation	of	evidence.

B	is	incorrect	because	integrity	refers	to	ensuring	that	data	has	not been	modified	in	an	authorized	manner	or	corrupted	throughout	its lifecycle.	This	is	of	particular	importance	with	many	types	of transactions,	especially	financial,	where	correct	data	and	processing are	essential.

C	is	incorrect	because	authentication	refers	to	the	process	of establishing	the	identity	of	a	user	or	service	that	is	requesting	access or	performing	operations	to	the	satisfaction	of	a	regulation	or	policy. Based	on	the	type	of	data	and	its	classification,	the	level	of	scrutiny and	proof	for	authentication	can	vary	greatly.

D	is	incorrect	because	availability	refers	to	data,	systems,	or	services
being	accessible	and	functioning	when	needed,	and	in	a	secure manner.	It	does	not	address	the	confidentiality	or	integrity	of	the	data or	systems	themselves,	nor	does	it	prove	origination	or	identity.

### Question # 27 - Within	a	PaaS	implementation,	which	of	the	following	is	NOT	the responsibility	of	the	cloud	provider?      
A.	Physical	environment      
B.	Infrastructure     
C.	Application	framework     
D.	Data     

Answer: D.	    

Under	all	cloud	service	categories,	the	security	and	protection	of data	is	the	sole	responsibility	of	the	cloud	customer.	Although	the cloud	provider	will	play	a	complimentary	role	with	data	security through	the	controls	it	implements	and	tools	it	provides	throughout	its entire	cloud	infrastructure,	the	ultimate	responsibility	for	compliance and	verification	lies	with	the	cloud	customer	as	the	owner	or	steward of	the	data.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	physical	environment	is	always	the responsibility	of	the	cloud	provider.	This	applies	to	all	cloud	service categories,	and	in	almost	all	instances,	the	cloud	customer	will	not have	any	insight	into,	or	really	any	need	to	know,	the	physical	security measures	or	even	the	locations	of	assets.

B	is	incorrect	because	infrastructure	within	the	PaaS	service	category is	the	responsibility	of	the	cloud	provider.	With	PaaS,	the	cloud provider	offers	a	fully	functional	application	framework	and environment	into	which	to	deploy	application	code	and	data,	and	the cloud	customer	is	not	responsible	for	any	operating	system	or infrastructure	design,	configuration,	or	maintenance.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	main	focus	of	the	PaaS	service	category	is on	providing	an	application	framework	for	the	cloud	customer	to deploy	code	and	data	into.	The	cloud	customer	will	have	considerable input	into	and	contractual	requirements	for	the	application	framework, but	it	is	the	responsibility	of	the	cloud	provider	to	meet	and	address those	needs	to	meet	SLA	requirements.

### [important] Question # 28 - Which	of	the	following	is	a	functionality	and	tool	offered	by	IRM solutions,	but	not	available	with	traditional	permissions	and	security settings?      
A.	Confidentiality     
B.	Expiration      
C.	Integrity     
D.	Copying     

Answer: B.	     

[important] **IRM	allows	for	many	extended	security	operations	and	functions that	are	not	available	with	traditional	permissions	and	settings.	
With traditional	permissions,	it	is	possible	to	limit	who	can	read	or	modify	a file,	but	with	read	permissions,	a	file	can	be	copied	very	easily	with	no limitations,	and	once	this	is	done,	it	can	be	used	forever.	
Even	if	the permissions	of	the	user	are	revoked	at	some	point,	if	the	user	has copied	or	downloaded	the	data,	he	can	still	access	it.	
With	IRM layered	on	top,	a	file	can	be	copied	or	downloaded	but	with	expiration restrictions	on	it.	
After	the	expiration	time	has	passed,	the	file	will	no longer	be	accessible.**

A	is	incorrect	because	confidentiality	can	be	provided	through traditional	permissions	and	settings	by	limiting	who	can	access	or	read data,	as	well	as	through	mechanisms	such	as	encryption.	However, once	the	ability	to	access	the	data	is	allowed,	there	is	nothing	to prevent	future	use	or	copying	of	data.

C	is	incorrect	because	integrity	can	be	assured	through	traditional permissions	by	denying	the	ability	to	write	or	delete	data.	If permissions	are	granted	to	modify	or	delete	data,	through	traditional permissions	there	is	not	any	mechanism	to	limit	how	much	of	the	data or	what	portions	of	it	can	be	modified	or	for	how	long,	as	IRM	could provide.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	ability	to	copy	is	inherent	with	the	ability	to read	data.	If	a	user	can	access	a	file	to	read	it,	he	can	also	copy	it, either	directly	copying	the	file	as	a	whole	unit	or	copying	the	data	out of	it	and	into	another	source.	IRM	is	capable	of	preventing	data	from being	copied	even	if	the	user	can	read	it.

### [important] Question # 29 - When	an	organization	implements	an	SIEM	solution	and	begins aggregating	event	data,	the	configured	event	sources	are	only	valid	at	the time	it	was	configured.	Application	modifications,	patching,	and	other upgrades	will	change	the	events	generated	and	how	they	are	represented over	time.	What	process	is	necessary	to	ensure	events	are	collected	and processed	with	this	in	mind?     
A.	Continual	review     
B.	Continuous	optimization      
C.	Aggregation	updates     
D.	Event	elasticity      

Answer: B.	   

**Continuous	optimization	is	the	process	where	event	data	is evaluated	on	an	ongoing	basis	to	catch	any	changes	in	formats	or additional	data	sources	to	correct	collection	methods.	
Applications	are always	changing,	and	without	continuous	optimization,	event	data would	likely	become	stale	or	incomplete	before	long.**

A	is	incorrect	because	the	term	“continual	review,”	although	it	sounds similar	to	continuous	optimization,	is	not	the	term	used	for	what	the question	is	asking.

C	is	incorrect	because	while	the	term	“aggregation	updates”	does sound	similar	and	captures	the	essence	of	what	continuous optimization	does,	it	is	not	a	real	term	or	commonly	used.

D	is	incorrect	because	“event	elasticity”	is	a	made-up	term	for	the purposes	of	the	question,	though	it	does	capture	the	concept	of	event data	and	pairing	with	the	elastic	nature	of	cloud	environments.
However,	it	is	not	pertinent	to	the	question.

### Question # 30 - Applying	restrictions	on	certain	activities	requires	the	use	of	information rights	management	(IRM).	Which	of	the	following	would	NOT	require	an IRM	solution?     
A.	Copy    
B.	Rename     
C.	Read    
D.	Print     

Answer: C.	   

**The	ability	to	restrict	who	can	read	data	or	files	does	not	require	the use	of	an	IRM	solution	and	can	be	accomplished	with	traditional security	controls	or	permissions	settings.**	
**This	can	be	done	either through	direct	file	permissions	or	the	use	of	ACLs,	or	even	by preventing	a	user	or	process	from	getting	to	the	file	at	all.**

A	is	incorrect	because	a	file	that	can	be	read	can	also	be	copied.	Even if	file	permissions	restrict	the	ability	to	insert	files	onto	the	file system,	the	contents	of	the	file	can	be	copied	through	a	variety	of methods.

B	is	incorrect	because	files	can	typically	be	renamed	if	they	can	be read	on	a	system.	Though	some	file	systems	can	prevent	new	files from	being	inserted,	which	will	also	prevent	them	from	being	renamed in	most	instances,	it	is	not	a	universal	capability	and	will	typically require	the	use	of	an	IRM	solution.

D	is	incorrect	because	printing	is	possible	if	a	file	can	be	read.	Once the	data	is	accessible,	even	if	printing	is	not	possible	directly	from	the host	system,	there	are	a	variety	of	ways	to	copy	or	move	data	that could	expose	it	to	being	printed.	IRM	technologies	can	be	used	in	a variety	of	ways	to	prevent	printing.

### [important tricky] Question # 31 - Which	cloud	service	category	is	object	storage	associated	with?      
A.	Software     
B.	Infrastructure      
C.	Desktop      
D.	Platform      
Answer: B.	    

Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS)	uses	object	and	volume	storage. Object	storage	is	where	data	is	stored	on	a	system	through	the	use	of an	opaque	descriptor	or	handler	and	then	accessed	with	it,	rather	than through	a	traditional	file	system	with	naming	conventions,	folders, and	so	on.

A	is	incorrect	because	Software	as	a	Service	(SaaS)	uses	its	own storage	mechanisms	that	are	specific	to	its	applications	and	not typically	accessible	by	a	cloud	customer	through	any	other	means	than the	application	interfaces.	Even	for	instances	where	file	objects	are allowed	to	be	stored,	they	are	done	so	through	application	interfaces and	are	only	accessible	through	those	means.

C	is	incorrect	because	Desktop	as	a	Service	(DaaS)	uses	storage	in	a similar	way	as	SaaS.	Storage	is	done	by	the	cloud	provider	and	is specific	to	the	way	its	systems	are	implemented.	DaaS	typically functions	as	a	SaaS	implementation,	where	applications	hosted	on	a cloud	platform	are	accessed	and	used	through	a	client.

D	is	incorrect	because	Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS)	uses	structured	and unstructured	storage	types.	Structured	storage	typically	resembles	a database-type	system,	where	the	organization	and	labels	are	well defined	and	used	by	the	application,	whereas	unstructured	storage serves	to	host	support	files	such	as	images,	web	objects,	configuration files,	and	so	on.

### Question # 32 - Which	of	the	following	is	NOT	a	common	component	of	a	DLP implementation	process?      
A.	Discovery    
B.	Monitoring      
C.	Revision     
D.	Enforcement      

Answer: C.	

Revision	is	not	a	core	component	of	a	data	loss	prevention	(DLP) process,	though	it	would	likely	be	part	of	an	organization’s	larger change	management	or	technical	advisory	processes.	For	any	DLP strategy	to	be	successful,	an	organization	must	include	other	processes in	the	workflow	for	revision	over	time	as	systems	change	and	data evolves,	but	revision	is	not	a	core	component	of	the	actual	DLP processes.

A	is	incorrect	because	data	discovery	is	a	key	component	of	a	DLP implementation.	DLP	systems	first	need	to	discover	the	data	they	are intended	to	protect	and	monitor,	either	through	specific	configurations of	data	sources	and	storage	systems	or	via	predefined	signatures	and other	discovery	method	to	find	new	data	as	it	comes	into	the	system	or is	accessed.

B	is	incorrect	because	monitoring	is	done	constantly	by	DLP	systems as	data	is	access	or	moved.	DLP	systems,	before	enforcing	polices	and controls,	need	to	constantly	monitor	data	and	network	operations	to match	against	rulesets	or	signatures.

D	is	incorrect	because	the	ultimate	goal	of	DLP	solutions	is	to	enforce policies	and	controls	on	data	as	it	is	being	used	or	moved.

### Question # 33 - Which	of	the	following	operations	can	be	controlled	and	prevented	withan	IRM	solution	but	would	not	be	possible	with	traditional	authorization mechanisms?     
A.	Read    
B.	Delete    
C.	Modify    
D.	Distribution      

Answer: D.	

**An	IRM	solution	can	control	what	can	be	done	with	data	beyond the	capabilities	of	restricting	its	access**.	
With	traditional	authorization systems,	once	someone	can	read	and	access	data,	there	is	little	that	can be	done	to	prevent	them	from	copying,	printing,	sharing,	or	otherwise distributing	it.	With	an	IRM	solution,	these	other	operations	can	be largely	avoided	or	eliminated.

A	is	incorrect	because	read	operations	can	be	controlled	by	traditional authorization	and	security	controls	and	do	not	need	an	IRM	solution. However,	an	IRM	solution	can	extend	those	controls	and	augment how	the	data	can	be	used	or	processed,	even	if	read	permissions	are granted.

B	is	incorrect	because	deletion	can	be	prevented	through	modify	or specific	delete	rights	with	traditional	permission	schemes	and controls.

C	is	incorrect	because	modify	is	a	core	capability	of	all	file	systems and	authorization	schemes,	and	IRM	is	not	needed	to	control	it, though	IRM	can	certainly	give	far	greater	and	more	granular	control over	it.

### [important] Question # 34 - Which	of	the	following	concepts	is	[NOT]	one	of	the	key	components	of	a [data-archiving]	program?     
A.	Format     
B.	Size     
C.	Regulations     
D.	Testing     

Answer: B.	

**Many	considerations	are	needed	to	develop	a	data-archiving program	and	establish	the	policies	that	govern	it,	but	the	size	of archives	is	a	technical	consideration	concerning	implementation,	not one	to	drive	policy**.	
Regulations	especially	focus	on	what	needs	to	be preserved	and	for	how	long,	but	the	size	of	the	archives	is	never	a consideration	under	regulatory	frameworks.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	format	of	archives	is	a	prime	consideration. It	ties	directly	to	regulatory	requirements	for	what	must	be	preserved, as	well	as	to	considerations	for	ensuring	it	can	later	be	restored	and accessed	for	the	duration	of	the	required	retention	period.

C	is	incorrect	because	regulations	are	the	most	central	and	important component	of	a	data-archiving	program.	They	define	what	needs	to	be preserved	and	what	the	retention	period	is.	Company	policies	or	other considerations	may	expand	on	the	regulatory	requirements,	but	the regulatory	requirements	will	always	form	the	minimum	basis	for retention.

D	is	incorrect	because	testing	is	vital	to	ensure	the	success	and compliance	of	an	archiving	program.	Although	identifying	data	that must	be	preserved	and	establishing	processes	to	do	so	are	vital,	the testing	of	the	restoration	capabilities	is	equally	as	vital.	Collecting data	and	archiving	it	will	not	fulfill	regulatory	requirements	if	the organization	is	later	unable	to	restore	or	access	it,	should	the	need arise.

### Question # 35 - Which	of	the	following	activities	is	NOT	something	typically	performed by	an	SIEM	solution?     
A.	Deletion     
B.	Alerting     
C.	Correlation    
D.	Aggregation     

Answer: A.	

An	SIEM	solution	will	aggregate	event	data	and	allow	for	analysis and	reporting	on	it.	However,	it	functions	as	only	a	consumer	of	event data;	it	does	not	maintain	the	data	from	the	source.	Data	is	copied	into an	SIEM	solution	from	agents	running	on	devices	or	servers,	or	it	is sent	via	syslog	technologies,	typically,	and	then	is	indexed	for	use.	An SIEM	solution	does	not	maintain	or	prune	the	data	that	is	being	sent	in at	all;	that	is	left	to	processes	external	to	the	solution.	Because	of	this, the	SIEM	solution	does	not	delete	data.

B	is	incorrect	because	alerting	is	a	core	function	of	an	SIEM	solution. Once	data	has	been	consumed	and	indexed	by	the	SIEM	solution, alerting	can	be	performed	based	on	any	correlations	or	values	found within	it.

C	is	incorrect	because	correlation	of	data	from	across	an	enterprise	is	a core	function,	and	one	of	the	main	benefits,	of	an	SIEM	solution.	With data	from	across	the	enterprise,	it	is	easy	to	search	across	different devices	or	systems	for	common	patterns	and	the	flow	of	processes	and data,	which	would	not	be	possible	on	isolated	servers.

D	is	incorrect	because	aggregation	is	perhaps	the	most	well	known function	of	an	SIEM	solution,	which	collects	data	from	many	different devices,	servers,	and	sources	and	then	indexes	it	for	use	in	a	single repository	and	searching	mechanism.

### Question # 36 - Which	of	the	following	would	be	considered	an	[indirect]	identifier?      
A.	Name      
B.	ZIP	Code     
C.	Educational	history      
D.	Address      

Answer: C.	    

Educational	history	is	not	considered	a	direct	identifier.	It	is	not specific	enough	to	attach	to	an	individual,	as	many	others	will	have attended	both	the	same	institutions	and	obtained	the	same	degrees	or studied	the	same	subjects.

A	is	incorrect	because	a	person’s	name	is	one	of	the	most	direct identifiers	available.	Although	some	common	names	are	shared	by many,	this	identifier	makes	for	very	quick	identification	of	an individual,	especially	within	a	small	population.

B	is	incorrect	because	a	ZIP	Code	is	typically	considered	specific enough	to	be	a	direct	identifier,	especially	with	the	ZIP+4	Code	that	is commonly	used	because	it	denotes	an	even	more	specific	location. Although	broader	geographic	terms	(such	as	city)	are	not	considered to	be	direct	identifiers,	a	ZIP	Code	is,	because	it	can	be	used	to quickly	narrow	down	and	point	to	specific	individuals.

D	is	incorrect	because	an	address	is	very	specific	to	an	individual	or	a residence.	With	the	address	alone,	it	is	possible	to	very	quickly	focus on	an	individual	directly.

### Question # 37 - Which	of	the	following	is	[NOT]	a	method	for	protecting	data	in	transit?      
A.	HTTPS       
B.	IPSec      
C.	DRM      
D.	TLS     

Answer: C.	     

Data	rights	management	(DRM)	works	by	protecting	how	data	is accessed	and	used,	specifically	relating	to	the	use	of	digital	and consumer	media,	such	as	movies,	audio	files,	and	images.	It	is	not focused	on	data	in	transit,	only	on	the	actual	use	and	access.

A	is	incorrect	because	HTTPS	is	the	main	method	for	secure	web	and web	service	communications.	It	is	widely	used	by	both	individuals and	systems	for	communicating	over	networks,	especially	the	public Internet,	in	a	secure	manner.

B	is	incorrect	because	IPSec	is	used	for	securing	communications directly	between	two	servers	via	encrypted	channels.	It	is	solely focused	on	data	in	transit	and	its	security.

D	is	incorrect	because	TLS	is	now	the	default	standard	encryption	and secure	model	for	most	network	communications,	but	especially	for web	and	web	services.	It	has	several	methods	for	both	securing	and ensuring	the	authentication	of	data-in-transit	communications.

### [important] Question # 38 - You	are	reviewing	literature	from	a	cloud	service	provider	and	its	main pitch	to	you	involves	its	offerings	for	a	“fully	installed	and	implemented application	hosting	and	deployment	framework.”	Based	on	your understanding	of	cloud	features,	which	storage	types	are	you	expecting	to see	offered	with	this	solution?     
A.	Volume	and	object    
B.	Structured	and	unstructured     
C.	Container	and	object    
D.	Volume	and	structured     

Answer: B.	

**The	phrase	“fully	installed	and	implemented	application	hosting and	deployment	framework”	describes	the	Platform	as	a	Service (PaaS)	cloud	service	category.	With	that	in	mind,	the	applicable storage	types	are	structured	and	unstructured.**

A	is	incorrect	because	volume	and	object	are	applicable	to Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS).	They	are	not	storage	types	used with	PaaS,	which	is	what	the	question	asks	for.

C	is	incorrect	because	container	and	object	are	not	recognized	storage types	associated	with	cloud	services.	Although	object	is	applicable	to IaaS	implementations,	container	is	typically	used	along	with deployment	technologies	such	as	Docker	rather	in	a	specific	storage context.

D	is	incorrect	because	although	both	volume	and	structured	are	storage types	used	within	cloud	environments,	they	span	two	different	cloud service	categories.	Volume	storage	is	associated	with	IaaS,	whereas structured	storage	is	associated	with	PaaS;	both	are	not	applicable	to the	PaaS	example	represented	in	the	question.

### [important] Question # 39 - Which	of	the	following	methods	or	strategies	is	[NOT]	a	method	for protecting	sensitive	data	from	data	sets?     
A.	Zeroing    
B.	Anonymization    
C.	Tokenization     
D.	Obfuscation       

Answer: A.	

**Zeroing	involves	replacing	and	overwriting	data	with	zeros	or	null values.**	

Although	it	is	a	successful	**strategy	for	guaranteeing	the	secure deletion	of	data**,	**it	would	not	be	considered	a	method	for	protecting sensitive	data,	because	it	would	actually	destroy	the	data.**

B	is	incorrect	because	anonymization	involves	removing	or	masking indirect	identifiers	in	data	sets	to	prevent	the	identification	of	specific individuals.	It	is	used	to	protect	sensitive	data	from	individual identification,	and	is	often	used	in	conjunction	with	other	strategies.

C	is	incorrect	because	tokenization	involves	replacing	sensitive	data with	opaque	or	key	values	so	that	the	original	sensitive	data	is	not presented.	Although	tokenization	can	allow	linking	back	to	the original	values,	it	definitely	is	a	method	for	protecting	sensitive information.

D	is	incorrect	because	obfuscation	is	typically	used	as	a	method	for making	data	sets	available	for	testing	of	development	or	nonproduction	systems	by	removing	sensitive	data	or	replacing	it	with other	values.

### Question # 40 - Which	of	the	following	areas	is	[NOT]	part	of	the	[CCM]	framework	and represented	as	a	domain?      
A.	Mobile	security     
B.	Human	resources      
C.	Governance    
D.	Financial	audit       

Answer: D.	

**[important] The	Cloud	Control	Matrix	(CCM)	serves	as	a	framework	for	cloud security	and	covers	the	areas	that	are	pertinent	to	it.**	
Although	the matrix	**contains	main	domains	and	areas	that	are	directly	applicable	to data	security	and	cloud	data	systems**,	
**financial	audit	is	not	included	as one	of	them.**

A	is	incorrect	because	mobile	security	is	one	of	the	domains	listed	as part	of	the	CCM.
B	is	incorrect	because	human	resources	is	listed	as	one	of	the	domains of	the	CCM,	as	it	pertains	directly	to	personnel	security	and	the prevention	of	malicious	insiders.
C	is	incorrect	because	governance	of	IT	data	and	resources	is	a	core domain	of	the	CCM.

### Question # 41 - The	final	phase	of	the	cloud	data	lifecycle	is	the	destroy	phase,	where	data is	ultimately	deleted	and	done	so	in	a	secure	manner	to	ensure	it	cannot	be recovered	or	reconstructed.	Which	cloud	service	category	poses	the	most challenges	to	data	destruction	or	the	cloud	customer?     
A.	Platform     
B.	Software    
C.	Infrastructure     
D.	Desktop     

Answer: B.	   

**With	Software	as	a	Service	(SaaS),	data	destruction	often	poses	the most	challenges	because	it	is	solely	the	responsibility	of	the	cloud provider,	but	also	because	most	platforms	tend	to	be	large implementations	with	many	customers	or	tenants	using	them**.	
**This makes	assurances	of	data	destruction	more	challenging	because	the methods	and	resources	available	can	be	limited**.

A	is	incorrect	because	Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS)	is	isolated	to	a specific	cloud	customer,	and	data	destruction	techniques	can	be	used without	interfering	with	others	or	causing	possible	conflicts.	The destruction	of	the	virtual	machine	wholesale	also	allows	for	options that	are	not	available	with	SaaS.

C	is	incorrect	because	Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS)	is	also	focused on	a	specific	customer,	and	the	destroy	phase	can	be	done	via	the destruction	of	the	virtual	machine	or	the	zeroing	of	data,	which	would not	be	possible	with	SaaS.

D	is	incorrect	because	Desktop	as	a	Service	(DaaS)	operates	much	as SaaS	and	carries	with	it	the	same	concerns,	but	is	more	segregated	by individual	cloud	customers.

### Question # 42 - During	[data	discovery	and	classification],	the	[use	of	metadata]	is	a	primary means	for	analysis.	Which	of	the	following	would	[NOT]	be	considered metadata?      
A.	Column	names    
B.	Content     
C.	Filenames     
D.	Headers    

Answer: B.	

Metadata	by	definition	is	data	about	data,	**so	the	actual	content	of the	data	would	not	fit	within	this	definition**.	
Content	analysis	goes against	the	actual	data	and	sources	rather	than	against	metadata.

A	is	incorrect	because	column	names	are	descriptive	and	structural information	about	the	data,	so	they	meet	the	definition	of	metadata. They	do	not	contain	actual	data	or	information,	only	information about	the	data	and	how	it	is	organized.

C	is	incorrect	because	filenames	are	information	about	data,	regardless of	the	naming	convention,	and	as	such	are	considered	metadata.

D	is	incorrect	because	headers	are	very	similar	column	names	and represent	information	about	the	data	and	how	it	is	organized	or categorized.	They	are	also	considered	metadata	and	descriptive	in nature.

### Question # 43 - Different	types	of	cloud	deployment	models	use	different	types	of	storage from	traditional	data	centers,	along	with	many	new	types	of	software platforms	for	deploying	applications	and	configurations.	Which	of	the following	is	[NOT]	a	storage	type	used	within	a	cloud	environment?    
A.	Docker    
B.	Object    
C.	Structured    
D.	Volume     

Answer: A.	

Docker	is	a	container	method	for	building,	shipping,	and	running applications	across	different	platforms	and	clients.	It	runs	within	its own	agents	and	containers,	is	not	a	storage	type	under	a	cloud deployment	model,	and	can	be	used	with	virtually	any	type	of platform.

B	is	incorrect	because	object	storage,	where	data	is	stored	as	an opaque	file	handler	or	descriptor	in	a	flat	file	system,	is	an	official cloud	storage	type	used	with	Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS).

C	is	incorrect	because	structured	storage,	where	data	is	stored	in	a database-type	application,	is	an	official	cloud	storage	type	used	with Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS).

D	is	incorrect	because	volume	storage,	where	data	is	stored	on	a logical	partition	resembling	a	traditional	file	system	hierarchy,	is	an official	cloud	storage	type	used	with	Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS).

### Question # 44 - When	data	is	required	to	be	archived	and	retained	for	extended	lengths	of time,	which	of	the	following	becomes	the	most	pressing	concern	over time?      
A.	Encryption      
B.	Size       
C.	Restoration       
D.	Availability       

Answer: C.	     

As	time	passes	and	organizations	change	out	software	and	other technologies,	it	is	imperative	that	the	ability	to	restore	archives	is maintained.	Given	that	some	regulatory	requirements	are	several	years or	longer,	and	with	the	rapid	development	of	technology	and upgrades,	it	is	very	possible	without	proper	planning	for	an organization	to	end	up	deprecating	the	capability	to	restore	archives before	they	have	reached	their	minimum	retention	time.	When	this happens,	an	organization	would	likely	have	to	contract	with	a	third party,	likely	at	a	very	high	cost,	for	restoration	services	should	the need	arise.

A	is	incorrect	because	the	concern	with	encryption	is	the	protection	of keys	over	time,	but	the	underlying	technology	and	capabilities	will still	exist	down	the	road.	This	is	different	than	with	software	and	other technologies	used	to	create	and	store	archives,	where	the	prospects	of being	deprecated	are	much	higher.

B	is	incorrect	because	although	the	size	of	archives	can	be	a	concern, especially	for	longer	retention	periods,	it	is	not	the	type	of	concern that	will	change	over	time	or	result	in	issues	with	deprecated technology.	Because	archives	by	nature	do	not	change,	size	will	not increase	with	data	that	is	already	archived,	and	additional	storage	can always	be	added,	as	needed,	to	handle	longer	retention	requirements, as	opposed	to	concerns	over	time	with	software	versions	and	access.

D	is	incorrect	because	archives	typically	are	housed	in	less	accessible means	of	storage,	many	times	on	tapes	kept	at	secure	external facilities.	When	the	need	for	restoration	arises,	it	may	take	some	time for	archives	to	be	retrieved	and	restored.	There	is	no	need	for	archives to	be	immediately	available,	and	the	contract	or	SLA	with	a	service provider	should	document	the	required	or	expected	restoration	times, ensuring	they	also	will	satisfy	any	regulatory	requirements.

### [tricky and important] Question # 45 - Which	of	the	following	[data	protection	methodologies]	maintains	the ability	to	connect	back	values	to	the	original	values?     
A.	Tokenization     
B.	Anonymization     
C.	Obfuscation     
D.	Dynamic	mapping     

Answer: A.	

**Tokenization	replaces	data	fields	with	opaque	handlers	or descriptors**.	
**In	the	process,	the	original	and	sensitive	information	is removed	from	the	data,	and	the	token	values	can	be	mapped	them back	to	the	original	values	if	needed**.

B	is	incorrect	because	anonymization	removes	indirect	identifiers	from data	sets	to	protective	sensitive	information	and	prevent	data	from being	matched	up	with	an	individual.	However,	the	goal	of anonymization	is	not	to	be	able	to	map	back	to	original	data	like	is possible	with	tokenization.

C	is	incorrect	because	obfuscation	often	replaces	values	with	garbage or	random	data,	and	as	such,	it	isn’t	possible	to	map	back	to	the original	values.	Obfuscation	is	typically	used	to	make	data	sets	for development	or	non-production	systems	for	testing	that	contain	the format	of	production	data	but	not	the	actual	values.

D	is	incorrect	because	dynamic	mapping	can	refer	to	many	things within	a	system	or	application,	but	in	this	instance	it’s	provided	as	an erroneous	choice.

### Question # 46 - Which	of	the	following	is	[not]	a	commonly	accepted	strategy	for	data discovery?      
A.	Labels     
B.	Metadata     
C.	Signature	hashing     
D.	Content	analysis       

Answer: C.	

**Data	discovery	is	focused	on	the	three	main	areas:	labels,	metadata, and	content	analysis.**	
Signature	hashing	may	be	used	for	some	of	these methods	for	comparison	and	efficiency,	but	it	would	be	used	as	a	tool or	process	rather	than	one	of	the	key	strategies.

A	is	incorrect	because	labels,	which	are	applied	to	data	for	grouping	or organization,	are	commonly	used	for	the	data	discovery	processes. The	main	shortcoming	with	using	labels	is	that	the	process	is dependent	on	the	accurate	and	complete	application	of	labels	before the	data	is	processed.

B	is	incorrect	because	metadata,	or	data	about	data,	is	commonly	used as	a	strategy	for	date	discovery	and	classification.	Metadata	uses attributes	such	as	type,	creator,	dates,	and	other	identifying information	about	the	data	itself	to	make	determinations	for	discovery.

D	is	incorrect	because	content	analysis,	which	is	done	against	the actual	data	itself,	is	a	main	strategy	for	data	discovery,	even	if	it	is	the slowest	and	least	accurate	method.	However,	as	tools	become	more mature	and	efficient,	the	use	of	content	analysis	is	rapidly	growing and	becoming	more	accurate	and	useful.

### Question # 47 - Although	the	[preservation	and	retention]	of	data	are	the	most	important concepts	that	usually	come	to	mind	when	you’re	[considering	archiving], what	process	is	equally	important	to	test	regularly	for	the	duration	of	the required	retention	period?      
A.	Recoverability    
B.	Portability    
C.	Encryption    

D.	Availability      
Answer: A.	

Over	time,	data	that	is	archived	can	become	inaccessible	if	an organization	loses	or	deprecates	the	systems	or	technologies	used	to archive	it,	thus	compromising	its	ability	to	restore	that	data.	Regular tests	should	be	done	to	ensure	data	can	still	be	recovered,	or	the organization	risks	failing	to	meet	regulatory	requirements.

B	is	incorrect	because	portability	is	the	quality	of	being	able	to	easily move	between	cloud	providers.	With	data	archives	being	static	storage objects,	portability	is	not	a	primary	concern,	nor	should	it	be	an impediment	if	a	new	hosting	provider	is	needed,	because	the	data types	and	formats	should	be	universal	and	abstracted	from	the	cloud provider.

C	is	incorrect	because	encryption	methods	will	still	be	available	over time,	as	long	as	the	keys	are	properly	maintained	and	secured.	This	is independent	of	a	specific	cloud	provider	or	specific	archiving	software
or	system.

D	is	incorrect	because	availability	is	not	a	primary	concern	with archiving.	Typically,	offsite	storage	or	storage	services	are	used	with archiving,	in	which	case	the	immediate	availability	for	restoration	will not	be	possible,	and	some	period	of	time,	defined	by	regulation,	is allowed	for	producing	records	and	evidence.

### Question # 48 - You	are	reviewing	the	standard	offerings	from	a	prospective	cloud provider,	and	one	area	of	[log	collection]	promises	full	and	complete	access to	operating	system	logs	for	all	provisioned	systems.	Which	cloud	service category	is	this	MOST	likely	referring	to?    
A.	Platform    
B.	Desktop    
C.	Software    
D.	Infrastructure     

Answer: D.	

With	Infrastructure	as	a	Service	(IaaS),	the	cloud	customer	is responsible	for	the	provisioning,	configuration,	and	support	of operating	systems	and	virtual	machines.	As	such,	the	customer	has full	access	to	all	systems	and	operating	system	logs,	whereas	with	the other	service	categories,	these	items	would	not	be	provided.

**A	is	incorrect	because	with	Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS),	the	operating system	is	maintained	by	the	cloud	provider	and	is	its	responsibility,	so chances	are	that	full	access	to	operating	system	logs	will	not	be provided	or	even	possible**.	
A	subset	may	be	made	available	through certain	tool	sets	or	an	SIEM	solution,	but	direct	and	full	access	is typically	not	be	provided.

B	is	incorrect	because	Desktop	as	a	Service	(DaaS)	works	much	like SaaS,	where	the	cloud	provider	is	responsible	for	the	overall	system, platform,	and	software,	and	would	not	make	full	operating	system logs	available	to	the	cloud	customer,	nor	would	the	cloud	provider necessarily	provide	a	high	level	of	value.

C	is	incorrect	because	the	operating	system	with	Software	as	a	Service (SaaS)	is	solely	the	responsibility	of	the	cloud	provider,	who	itself would	retain	full	access	to	operating	system	logs.	Because	the	cloud provider	is	solely	responsible	for	the	logs,	there	would	be	little	need for	the	cloud	customer	to	have	access	to	them.

### [important tricky] Question # 49 - Which	of	the	following	will	always	serve	as	the	[starting	point	for	the minimum	period	of	data	retention]?    
A.	Contract     
B.	Regulation     
C.	System	resources    
D.	Company	policy     

Answer: B.	

Regulation	will	dictate,	based	on	the	type	and	content	of	data,	the minimum	period	of	data	retention,	as	well	as	what	events	must	be captured	for	retention.	
Regulation	is	specific	to	the	type	of	data	and the	jurisdiction	where	it	is	located	or	consumed.

A	is	incorrect	because	a	contract	will	articulate	and	document	data retention	requirements	between	the	cloud	customer	and	the	cloud provider;	it	will	not	serve	as	the	basis	for	the	actual	policy	dictating those	requirements.

C	is	incorrect	because	system	resources	would	never	be	a	factor	for determining	data	retention	requirements,	as	regulation	would	always supersede	them,	and	it	would	be	the	responsibility	of	the	cloud customer	to	ensure	that	sufficient	system	resources	were	allocated	to support	and	meet	retention	requirements.

D	is	incorrect	because	company	policy	forms	the	end	basis	for	data retention,	but	the	starting	point	will	always	be	regulation.	Company policies	may	always	expand	and	build	upon	regulations,	but regulations	will	always	form	the	minimum	starting	basis	for	retention requirements.

### Question # 50 - Which	type	of	masking	would	be	appropriate	for	the	creation	of	data	sets for	testing	purposes,	where	the	same	structure	and	size	are	of	importance?       
A.	Dynamic    
B.	Structured    
C.	Tokenized     
D.	Static    

Answer: D.	    

**Static	masking	is	used	to	produce	full	data	sets,	with	sensitive	data removed,	often	for	the	purposes	of	testing	or	development,	where	the structure	and	size	will	need	to	resemble	production	data,	just	without the	actual	sensitive	values.**

A	is	incorrect	because	**dynamic	masking	is	done	between	the	data	and application	layers,	and	is	meant	for	transaction	purposes	rather	than the	production	of	data	sets**.

B	is	incorrect	because	**“structured”	refers	to	a	type	of	storage	used under	Platform	as	a	Service	(PaaS).	It	is	not	a	masking	technique.**

C	is	incorrect	because	“tokenized”	could	refer	to	tokenization,	where sensitive	data	is	replaced	by	opaque	handlers	or	descriptors,	but	with the	ability	to	map	back	to	the	original	values.	However,	this	process would	not	be	used	for	producing	test	data	sets,	where	such	a	capability would	be	inappropriate	and	unnecessary.
